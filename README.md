# Shapes
*A Music Method for the Expert Beginner*

### Welcome
The following is a path into the world of Shapes. It winds again and again through the lands of Symbols, of Instruments, and of Imagination, where finally it falls clear off the edge of this world, so that you will have to go and discover another. Along the way, you'll get a good sense of what Shapes has to offer, and you may even come across a path of your own.


### Shapes Basics Series

#### 1. A Shape  

Use a single shape to play along with a playlist of songs. Hear when notes fit or don't fit, and start to follow your musical intuition.

#### 2. A Group of Shapes

- Part 1: Expand to a full group of shapes and continue playing with songs.
- Part 2: See the group as a system and add a way to name the shapes.

#### 3. Shape Fingerings

- How hands match the keyboard, and how to play hands together in any shape, beginning on any note, using only one fingering pattern.

#### 4. The Anchor Note

- Introduce the anchor, hear the pull, start to recognize it in songs.

#### 5. Playing With the Anchor

- Use the anchor note to focus your playing. Balance structure and play.

#### 6. Bass Notes

- Introduce bass notes around the anchor. Hear them structuring the song. Use them to create additional structures.

#### 7. Matching A Shape

- Match a song with a shape on your own. Start by using a diagram, then use adjacent notes to fill in the shape.

#### 8. Notes in Time

- Represent bass notes relative to the anchor using a staff instead of the keyboard. Then add a way to represent time.

#### 9. Groups of Shapes

- Introduce three other groups of shapes and listen to their qualities. Relate the groups through their common shape names.

#### 10. Changes

- Introduce changing shapes and anchors. Distinguish changes at the key and chord levels.

#### 11. Reading by Touch

- Begin SR Tactile sequence through anchor, two higher, two lower. which will include a thumb pivot.

#### 12. A Tonescape and Tensions

- Introduce a tonescape and get into **passive** tensions (anchor-higher-lower)

#### 13. Imagination as an Instrument

- Hearing notes inside a tonescape
- Anchor-higher-lower **active**

#### 14. Tensions Part 2 (Follows from 12)

- Add two higher and two lower tensions **passive**

#### 15. Reading by Ear

- Begin SR Imagery sequence in the netural mood.
- Anchor, two higher, and two lower **active**

#### 16. Naming Tensions

- Switch the tensions naming model to 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 6th.

#### 17. Reading by Touch Part 2 (Follows from 11)

- Add 5L and 5R shapes to SR tactile sequence.
- Continue with anchor, one and two higher, one and two lower.

#### 18. Moods (Follows from 14)

- changing shapes on a single anchor introduces the idea of moods, and their spectrum of lightness/heaviness.
- add the single light and single heavy tonescapes
- anchor, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 6th in neutral, single light & single heavy tonescapes **passive**

#### 19. Reading by Ear Part 2 (Follows from 15)

- SR Imagery sequence in neutral, single light, and single heavy moods
- anchor, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 6th.

#### 20. Light & Heavy Tensions

- Introduce "light/heavy" tension names as a more specific way to name tensions that vary in different moods.
- The light/heavy mood names are a sum of their light/heavy tensions
- the tension number becomes something abstracted from the specific tension, which is how letter names (& traditional solfege) will work. This sets up IPs.

#### 21. Independent Solfege

- Introduce independent solfege names & distinguish from relative names.

#### 22. Reading by Touch Part 3 (Follows from 17)

- Introduce 4th and 5th to the SR tactile sequence (all tensions)
- Then add 4L and 4R shapes.

#### 23. Moods and Tensions Together (Follows from 18)

- Add 4th and 5th (all diatonic tensions)
- begin using light/heavy names for all tensions
- all diatonic tensions in neutral, single light & single heavy tonescapes **passive**

#### 24. Getting Inside of Moods

- Add double light & double heavy tonescapes, shuffle all.

#### 25. Reading by Ear Part 3 (Follows from 19)

- SR Imagery sequence through double light & heavy moods
- All diatonic tensions

#### 26. Incidentals

- Introduce incidentals as a way of notating tensions outside of the shape.

#### 27. Making Time Relative

- Introduce rhythmic note symbols as subdivisions
- Align different subdivisions with pulse dots, what looks best?
- Now possible to remove pulse dots (abstracts away from regular note spacing)

#### 28. Reading by Touch Part 4 (Follows from 22)

- Add 3L and 3R shapes to the SR tactile sequence.
- Continue all tensions, bring in some rhythmic note symbols.
- Any changing songs that use these shapes?

#### 29. All Moods and Tensions (Follows from 23/24)

- Add triple light & triple heavy tonescapes (all moods), shuffle all.
- Bring all tensions so far into the neutral tonescape. Relate to incidentals.

#### 30. Reading by Ear Part 4 (Follows from 25)

- SR Imagery sequence all moods
- All diatonic tensions
- Bring in some rhythmic note symbols

#### 31. Mood Names

- Introduce standard(ish) mood names in place of light/heavy names.
- Also name 2nd, 3rd, 4th group moods and relate their light/heavy positions.

#### 32. Reading by Touch Part 5 (Follows from 28)

- Add remaining (2L/R, 1L/R, B) shapes to the SR tactile sequence.
- Continue using rhythmic note symbols
- Play with changing songs
- Perhaps bring in some incidentals (if that works with songs)

#### 33. Holding on to the Anchor (Follows from 29)

- Continue all tensions so far into the neutral tonescape.
- Then drop the tonescape and stay oriented to the anchor.
- Try this with Indepent Solfege Names, too (gateway to Independent Relationship).

#### 34. Imagination as an Instrument Part 2

- Shuffle all tonescapes, all groups.
- Name the mood, and free play imagery inside of it.
