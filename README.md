### A Suggested Path
The following path is not the only path through this world, nor is it the shortest path. It winds its way again and again through the lands of Symbols, of Instruments, and of Imagination, where, if followed dilligently, it falls clear off the edge of this world, so that you will have to go and discover another. Thus forewarned, you may wish to follow your own path, in which case, you've come to the right world.

### A Working Outline

Start &#8674;  
Thinking Music Theory Anew

> To introduce the approach and preempt questions like "where are the note names?" or "aren't you just drawing scales on the piano..." etc.

&#8674; Imagination-Symbols  
Playing With the World

> The notion of a group of notes fitting with a song. "fit" and "don't fit," as floating dots. Also the matters of the songs as the world, and the "fit" as a kind of tacit knowledge to leverage.

> Interesting to think what it means to draw out this particular aspect of a tacit relationship with the world, and to be able to play around with it. this both separates us from the world, and brings us closer. it's a sort of scientific discovery, a potential to modify the world, or to inquire into it...

&#8674; Symbols  
Widening the Scope

> The matter of that same group fitting with lots of songs, then reconfiguring the in/out groups to fit with any (single-group) song. so here we can see, for one, how lots of apps etc work. we can also get the sense that there's something common to all these groups, at least that in each case, seven notes seem to fit and five don't, but we *can't see the pattern with this kind of diagram*. so we can invent a different way to represent this idea.

> mapping dots to a shape on the keyboard. here you can still see which notes "fit" and "don't fit," and the group now has a distinctive contour. from there we can look at a system of shapes--to answer the question, "so how many groupings are there?" and this gives us a much different feeling of orientation. we're not in the weeds of the floating dots anymore, but standing back and able to reflect on something much larger.

> a third layer, this will involve naming the shapes. so you can recognize that the shape itself can be a symbol for the grouping, and then at a higher level of abstraction, a verbal description of the symbol, which, in theory, you could also use to describe the pre-shape grouping of notes. and these all depend on each other, and assist each other--the names, for example, describe the shape spatially and numerically, which makes it easier to remember, and to describe as a system.

&#8674; Symbols-Instruments  
Connecting With a Tradition

> apply this. it's not just a cool insight, but now you can improvise with any of these songs. it connects you (your intuition) via a symbol (the shape) to the musical world around you. To a community, both now, and in the past. that ought to feel profound.

> [Pre-instrument reflection](world/pre-instrument-reflection.md).

&#8674; Instruments  
Shape Fingerings

> and now we're into Instrument territory. why not introduce the physical correspondence, symmetry, and basic shape fingering? you can start on any note, and use the same fingering for any shape. show the top shape fingering and the rule, but suggest branching outward gradually. touch on what this accomplishes in terms of connecting your body to the instrument. and also what it represents (the interface-body relationship) that you could apply to thinking about other instruments--to instruments generally. not to mention diagrams.

&#8674; Instruments-Imagination  
The Anchor Note

> this is time to introduce the idea of the anchor note. it's also a kind of tacit knowledge, but not necessarily as clearly as the grouping was. it's something that you can draw out, and develop with the help of an instrument. (and remember here that an instrument is no longer separable from a symbol, a constructed idea).

&#8674; Imagination  
Structured Invention

> this could be like app lesson 4, imagined structures, pre-notation, focused by the anchor. i like that. in a strange way, it's a precursor to the structured "anchor-higher-lower" entry into a tonescape, and the way that moves into structured movement around a tonescape, and then gradually less structured movement--or rather, that the structuring becomes gradually more internalized. So there's a sort of opposition being set up here, on one hand, a sort of rational structuring, and on the other, an imaginitive unstructuring.

> this also suggests some other ways to read the regions of overlap. "Instruments-Imagination" can mean, as it does here at first, instruments to aid the imagination, but later, it can also become the imagination as an instrument. also, overlaps are spatially opposite to the center of a region--can you say, for example, that the overlap of Symbols and Instruments is polar to the land of Imagination proper?

&#8674; Imagination-Symbols  
Capturing Music

> here will be the place to introduce positional shape notation--a way to capture those structures from imagination-symbols, but only in terms of a succession of events.

&#8674; Symbols  
A Regular Pulse

> add abstracted time, the idea of a regular pulse. think about how different this is from the actual events taking place in the music, why it belongs squarely in the land of symbols, and what that suggests about symbols more generally.

&#8674; Symbols-Instruments  
When Things Change

> notation as an instrument for capturing events in time. like changing shapes and anchors. which complicates the matter of exactly when they change--on the pulse or the event? does notation require a notion of time, and what different approaches to and representations of time are possible? think of a scrolling display versus symbolic rhythmic notation.

> and what about changes in the events themselves, for example, on a second listening once the context has changed. that's heavy. but the practical take-away is really something like beginning a foundation for ideas like harmonic rhythm, and song structure, and chords changes... spotting when things change, points of articulation, with notation as the "instrument" to do that.

&#8674; Instruments  
The Feeling of Fluency

> notation-pulse-fingering (begin the sight reading sequence). this is the matter, and feeling of fluent reading, and there's a physical, instrumental aspect to that.

> here, since we have shape, anchor, and pulse established, could also be a digression on harmonic mixing in a DJ set. That requires pulse, although pulse wouldn't be the focus.

&#8674; Instruments-Imagination  
Imagination as an Instrument

> get into passive tonescapes (anchor-higher-lower), as the matter of how to know exactly which notes you're hearing. this is the transition from "instruments to aid the imagination" to "the imagination as an instrument.

> introduce and derive a tonescape (that sound in the background) from events moving in a song. This is truly an "instrument to aid the imagination," abstracted from the physical instrument in a different way than a symbol is.

&#8674; Imagination  
Playing Your Mind's Ear

> active anchor-higher-lower. this is actually, concretely starting to play your imagination as an instrument by directing your attention. a precursor to playing your mind's ear. trippy.

&#8674; Imagination-Symbols  
Reading Without an Instrument

> the sight reading activity, but using active tonescapes instead of a physical instrument.

&#8674; Symbols  
...

> maybe back to this question of what generalizes across the groups? half and whole steps as an abstraction? the tonal version of the abstraction set up by time in the last pass through Symbols.

> and/or a way to start getting into context names, or even note names.
