### Shapes Basics Series

#### [Lesson 1: A Shape](https://shapesmusic.github.io/shapes-method/lessons/01-a-shape.html)

Use a single shape to play along with a playlist of songs. Hear when notes fit or don't fit, and start to follow your musical intuition.

#### [Lesson 2: Different Shapes](https://shapesmusic.github.io/shapes-method/lessons/02-different-shapes.html)

Add some different shapes and continue playing along with songs.

#### [Lesson 3: A Group of Shapes](https://shapesmusic.github.io/shapes-method/lessons/03-a-group.html)

See the shapes as a group, and add a way to name the shapes.

#### [Lesson 4: Shape Fingerings](lessons/04-shape-fingerings.md)

- How hands match the keyboard, and how to play hands together in any Ã·shape, beginning on any note, using only one fingering pattern.

#### [Lesson 5: The Anchor Note](lessons/05-the-anchor-note.md)

- Introduce the anchor, hear the pull, start to recognize it in songs.

![wireframe](wireframes/5.1.png)



#### [Lesson 6: Playing With the Anchor](lessons/06-playing-with-the-anchor.md)

- Use the anchor note to focus your playing. Balance structure and play.

![wireframe](wireframes/6.1.png)



#### [Lesson 7: Bass Notes](lessons/07-bass-notes.md)

- Introduce bass notes around the anchor. Hear them structuring the song. Use them to create additional structures.

![wireframe](wireframes/7.1.png)



#### [Lesson 8: Matching A Shape](lessons/08-matching-a-shape.md)

- Match a song with a shape on your own. Start by using a diagram, then use adjacent notes to fill in the shape.

![wireframe](wireframes/8.1.png)



#### [Lesson 9: Notes in Time](lessons/09-notes-in-time.md)

- Represent bass notes relative to the anchor using a staff instead of the keyboard. Then add a way to represent time.

#### [Lesson 10: Changes](lessons/10-changes.md)

- Introduce changing shapes and anchors. Distinguish changes at the key and chord levels.

![wireframe](wireframes/10.1.png)



#### [Lesson 11: Groups of Shapes](lessons/11-groups-of-shapes.md)

- Introduce three other groups of shapes and listen to their qualities. Relate the groups through their common shape names.



#### [Lesson 12: Reading by Touch](lessons/12-reading-by-touch.md)

- Begin SR Tactile sequence through anchor, two higher, two lower, TOP shape only, Pe anchor. which will include a thumb pivot.

![wireframe](wireframes/12.1.png)



#### [Lesson 13: A Tonescape and Tensions](lessons/13-a-tonescape-and-tensions.md)

- Introduce a tonescape and get into **passive** tensions (anchor-higher-lower)



#### [Lesson 14: Imagination as an Instrument](lessons/14-imagination-as-an-instrument.md)

- Hearing notes inside a tonescape
- Anchor-higher-lower **active**



#### Lesson 15: Tensions Part 2

- Add two higher and two lower tensions **passive**



#### [Lesson 16: Reading by Ear](lessons/16-reading-by-ear.md)

- Begin SR Imagery sequence in the netural mood.
- Anchor, two higher, and two lower **active**



#### [Lesson 17: Switch To Number Names](/lessons/17-switch-to-number-names.md)

- Switch the tensions naming model to 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 6th.



#### Lesson 18: Reading by Touch Part 2

- Add 5L and 5R shapes to SR tactile sequence.
- Continue with anchor, one and two higher, one and two lower.

![wireframe](wireframes/18.1.png)



#### [Lesson 19: Moods](lessons/19-moods.md)

- changing shapes on a single anchor introduces the idea of moods, and their spectrum of lightness/heaviness.
- add the single light and single heavy tonescapes
- anchor, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 6th in neutral, single light & single heavy tonescapes **passive**



#### Lesson 20: Reading by Ear Part 2

- SR Imagery sequence in neutral, single light, and single heavy moods
- anchor, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 6th.



#### Lesson 21: Light & Heavy Tensions

- Introduce "light/heavy" tension names as a more specific way to name tensions that vary in different moods.
- The light/heavy mood names are a sum of their light/heavy tensions
- the tension number becomes something abstracted from the specific tension, which is how letter names (& traditional solfege) will work. This sets up IPs.



#### [Lesson 22: Independent Solfege](lessons/22-independent-solfege.md)

- Introduce independent solfege names & distinguish from relative names.



#### [Lesson 23: Reading by Touch Part 3](lessons/23-reading-by-touch-3.md)

- Introduce 4th and 5th to the SR tactile sequence (all tensions)
- Then add 4L and 4R shapes.

![wireframe](wireframes/23.1.png)



#### [Lesson 24: Moods and Tensions Together](lessons/24-moods-and-tensions-together.md)

- Add 4th and 5th (all diatonic tensions)
- begin using light/heavy names for all tensions
- all diatonic tensions in neutral, single light & single heavy tonescapes **passive**



#### [Lesson 25: Getting Inside of Moods](lessons/25-getting-inside-of-moods.md)

- Add double light & double heavy tonescapes, shuffle all.



#### Lesson 26: Reading by Ear Part 3

- SR Imagery sequence through double light & heavy moods
- All diatonic tensions



#### Lesson 27: Incidentals

- Introduce incidentals as a way of notating tensions outside of the shape.



#### Lesson 28: Making Time Relative

- Introduce rhythmic note symbols as subdivisions
- Align different subdivisions with pulse dots, what looks best?
- Now possible to remove pulse dots (abstracts away from regular note spacing)

![wireframe](wireframes/28.1.png)



#### Lesson 29: Reading by Touch Part 4

- Add 3L and 3R shapes to the SR tactile sequence.
- Continue all tensions, bring in some rhythmic note symbols.
- Any changing songs that use these shapes?

![wireframe](wireframes/29.1.png)



#### [Lesson 30: All Moods and Tensions](lessons/30-all-moods-and-tensions.md)

- Add triple light & triple heavy tonescapes (all moods), shuffle all.
- Bring all tensions so far into the neutral tonescape. Relate to incidentals.



#### Lesson 31: Reading by Ear Part 4

- SR Imagery sequence all moods
- All diatonic tensions
- Bring in some rhythmic note symbols



#### Lesson 32: Mood Names

- Introduce standard(ish) mood names in place of light/heavy names.
- Also name 2nd, 3rd, 4th group moods and relate their light/heavy positions.



#### Lesson 33: Reading by Touch Part 5

- Add remaining (2L/R, 1L/R, B) shapes to the SR tactile sequence.
- Continue using rhythmic note symbols
- Play with changing songs
- Perhaps bring in some incidentals (if that works with songs)

![wireframe](wireframes/33.1.png)



#### Lesson 34: Holding on to the Anchor

- Continue all tensions so far into the neutral tonescape.
- Then drop the tonescape and stay oriented to the anchor.
- Try this with Indepent Solfege Names, too (gateway to Independent Relationship).



#### Lesson 35: Imagination as an Instrument Part 2

- Shuffle all tonescapes, all groups.
- Name the mood, and free play imagery inside of it.
