### Welcome
The following path is not the only path through this world, nor is it the shortest path. It winds again and again through the lands of Symbols, of Instruments, and of Imagination, where finally it falls clear off the edge of this world, so that you will have to go and discover another. Thus forewarned, you may wish to follow your own path, in which case, you've come to the right world.
