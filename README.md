### A Path
The following path is not the only path through this world, nor is it the shortest path. It winds again and again through the lands of Symbols, of Instruments, and of Imagination, where finally, it falls clear off the edge of this world, so that you will have to go and discover another world. Thus forewarned, you may wish to find your own path, in which case, you've come to the right world.

- Then map that to a keyboard (the central play experience, heading toward instruments)
