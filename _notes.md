- 2021-09-21 Bass Notes Review & Notes in Time w/Nora (Video)

**Notes**

- Look at Lesson 8 Notation alongside this one. They're related.
- Some good bass note songs:

    - I Like It, Enrique Iglesias
    - one minute more, capital cities (easy, two notes)
    - Counting Stars, One Republic (4 notes)
    - New order
    - El Perdedor Enrique Iglesias (2 sections with a connecting section--really good)

### Lesson 10 - Changes

**Notes**



### Lesson 11 - Groups of Shapes

**References**

- 2009-10 lesson sketch - groups of shapes (part 2)

**Notes**

- Similar to Lesson 19, where you want to get to know the broader feeling of a group, rather than getting inside it and thinking about its parts. 
- Could shuffle all modes and try to hear if it's a 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th group mood.



### Commentary: Chord-Modes

**References**

**Notes**

- There was a thought to put this after 19 - Moods. But that lesson is more about begining to recognize specific moods, whereas chord-modes follow from the combination of Changes (Lesson 10) and Groups of Shapes (Lesson 11).

### Lesson 14 - Imagination as an Instrument

**References**

- 2022-03-15_nora_basics_14_tonescapes.wav

**Notes**

- And speaking of developing control of what we hear, our next tonescapes is to hear the note *inside* the tonescape. Start by listening to the static sound changing. Then demo the "inside a tonescape," then try the Tonescapes 3 recording. Once you've got that, the two higher and two lower is a sheet of notation, with an anchor clef, that you can flip upside down.

### Commentary: Feeling or Thinking?

**References**

**Notes**

- From a conversation with Josh after class 23.2.21
  - light/heavy as a framework, then mode names, then "dominant"
  - a superstructure of major/minor corresponding to light/heavy
  - if you reduce it to maj/min, you lose a whole level of nuanced hearing
  - *but then it's not necessarily about hearing everything modally: modes are a way in to hearing chromatic tensions to an anchor, that imply contexts. or even just to hearing nuanced tensions in context
  - the big thing to come out of today was that they wanted the logos, and then could believe they heard differences between the modes. but i set up shapes to try to work with just the feeling. that's a different skill, and it's valuable enough to foreground. it matters
  - josh asked why i don't just play the few notes we're working with in the tonescape. because we want every opportunity to parse the sound, to spend more time with it. And also, to hear the full context matters.

### Commentary: Shape and Standard Notation

**References**

**Notes**

- There's no explicit sequence for the notation system--it's embedded across the other threads:
  - Staff is introduced in Lesson 9 - Notes In Time (Playing & Vocab)
  - used (and developed?) in Lesson 10 - Changes (Chord & Key)
  - Lesson 12+ (in SR Tactile Sequence)...
  - Lesson 16+ (SR Imagery)
- Think about this alongside FR_Music 3 Note Naming Systems
