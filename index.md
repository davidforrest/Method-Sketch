#### Hello

Shapes offers a way to quickly begin connecting your musical intuition with the wide world of musical tools, instruments, and concepts. 

It zooms out from traditional ideas like chord, scale, and key, and introduces a different kind of concept—a Shape—that lets you immediately play along with any song you hear. Playing with a Shape taps into the same feeling an experienced musician has once they've internalized years of learning.

Welcome to Shapes! a music method that gives access to a deeper level than what's usually possible. lets you play with songs, imagine sounds, and see music notation in a different way. it has developed through hundreds of lessons, and workshops in ASAS, etc. The best way to start getting to know Shapes is by getting into the self-learning course, which was developed as part of a PhD thesis at Harvard University. although it looks very different from traditional music learning, it's designed to enrich your experience of both established and emerging ideas in music, and to provide a foundation for the various music-learning opportunities you encounter throughout your life.

Shapes is...

this should be a video, really, with minimal text surrounding it.

​	possibly several videos: an overview and some deeper cuts. modular dissertation talk /writing/about.md. 

and description of the structure of products. clear options for what to do here, not just information on what it's about.

roles: learner, teacher... a teacher is just a more experienced learner

- for the beginner it lets you access the intuition of an expert. for the expert it lets you reassess/rediscover the things you know as a beginner
- start with a very clear statement: it's a music method that lets you
  - play along with any song
  - rethink the way you read music
  - (and something about ears)
- it's unique in terms of its philosophy, theory, and methodology.
- the best way to get to know Shapes is to dive into a very comprehensive self-study course that's just openly available. it takes some self-starting, but gives you a lot of content to work with.
- shapes creates a foundation that gives you a big advantage in studying any other music learning resource (that idea, anyway)
- give real content in the first impression, though. not just some vague big picture stuff that could apply to any method.
- What Eyal noticed, it’s a way of focusing on something deeper, not just the surface layer, from the beginning. Giving beginners access to something deeper. and also its value as a compositional tool
- and: have you tried it with actual students...?
