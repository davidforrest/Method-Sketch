      <p><span>So a great way to get started with Shapes is with a playlist of songs, and a single shape.</span></p>
      <p><span>The Shapes Playlist is a kind of fun, random mix of songs that you might come across just by being a person living in the world right now.</span></p>
      <p><span>And the thing in the middle is a shape. It&#39;s two little strokes drawn over a keyboard.</span></p>
      <p><span>So here&#39;s how to read a shape.</span></p>
      <p><img src="../media/dots_to_shape.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="dots to shape"></p>
      <p><span>Imagine you have a bunch of notes floating in the air.</span><br /><span>And then you map those notes onto keys of the keyboard.</span><br /><span>Then you draw lines that connect the notes together,</span></p>
      <p><span>and then the lines themselves become a way to represent all those notes at once.</span></p>
      <p><span>The point of a shape is that you can remember it really quickly [on diagram]: thereâ€™s this little stroke, and then this kind of rainbow looking stroke.</span></p>
      <p><span>If I play it on the keyboard, it&#39;s these two notes [play]</span><br /><span>and then the rainbow. [play]</span></p>
      <p><span>You can play the notes of the shape in any order, or any combination, anywhere on the keyboard, and they&#39;re going to sound like they fit with the song. [play] You can also use any fingers you like. You can even use just one finger. [play]</span></p>
      <p><span>Now, if you play any notes that </span><em><span>aren&#39;t</span></em><span> in the shape, they sound pretty different, like they really </span><em><span>don&#39;t</span></em><span> fit. [play]</span></p>
      <p><span>But the notes in the shape do, in any order, and any combination. [play]</span></p>
      <p><span>So give it a shot. Try using the shape to play some notes along with a song. And if you don&#39;t like the song that&#39;s playing, keep skipping forward until you get a song that catches your interest.</span></p>
      <p><span>Playing with a shape is very open-ended, but you&#39;ll find that you have some intuition about what to play just because of all the music you already listen to.</span></p>
      <p><span>A really good guideline is to try playing as though you&#39;re adding a new layer to the song, something that sounds good to </span><em><span>you</span></em><span>.</span></p>
      <p><span>So you&#39;re not necessarily trying to play </span><em><span>the song</span></em><span> or </span><em><span>the melody</span></em><span>, or anything like that. It&#39;s more that you&#39;re letting yourself become a part of the music, you&#39;re participating and adding something of your own.</span></p>
      <p><span>So I&#39;ll give you just a few more tips before I leave you to it.</span></p>
      <p><span>If you ever have trouble hearing how the shape fits with a song, listen again to some of those notes that </span><em><span>aren&#39;t</span></em><span> in the shape, and compare them with notes that are.</span></p>
      <p><span>This can really help you hear the fit. Plus, they tell you very clearly if you accidentally play a note that isn&#39;t in the shape.</span></p>
      <p><span>Also, don&#39;t be afraid to play with songs you don&#39;t know, or songs that are very different from what you usually like to listen to.</span></p>
      <p><span>When you play the same shape with lots of different songs, you find yourself playing and listening in different ways, and you stretch the experience a lot further.</span></p>
      <p><span>And finally, how do you know you&#39;ve &quot;got it&quot; and are ready to move on?</span></p>
      <p><span>I&#39;d say at the very least, try finding 3 different songs in the playlist that you like, play through the length of the whole song, and really let yourself get into it.</span></p>
      <p><span>From there, you might decide to keep going, or stop, but ask yourself if you feel comfortable playing with the shape, and when you mostly do, that&#39;s when you&#39;re ready to move on.</span></p>
