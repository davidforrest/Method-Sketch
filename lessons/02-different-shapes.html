      <p><span>So, something has changed about the playlist.</span></p>
      <p><span>Now, when you switch songs, you&#39;re going to get some different shapes. </span></p>
      <p><span>[show]</span></p>
      <p><span>All of these shapes work just like the shape you already played with. Except, of course, they&#39;re made up of different notes.</span></p>
      <p><span>So the notes in </span><em><span>this</span></em><span> shape are... [show]</span></p>
      <p><span>If I choose a different song, here, the notes are... [show]</span></p>
      <p><span>So try a few of these yourself. Find a song you like that has a new shape, then get the notes down and try playing along with the song, just like you did before. </span></p>
      <p><span>[show]</span></p>
      <p><span>You can remember any one of these shapes pretty much right away, and then you can think of the </span><em><span>shape</span></em><span> rather than having to remember each of the individual notes that make it up.</span></p>
      <p><span>So go ahead and play around with these new shapes a little bit.</span></p>
      <p><span>You&#39;ll get to know the shapes gradually just by playing with them, so when each new shape that pops up starts to feel like it&#39;s one you&#39;ve maybe seen before, that&#39;s when you&#39;re ready to move on.</span></p>
