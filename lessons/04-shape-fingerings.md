# Shape Fingerings

## Lesson Script

**Shapes Basics No. 4 - Shape Fingerings**

---

Now, when you're playing, you can use any fingers you like. But the keyboard actually _matches_ your hands, and this can really help you out.

Our hands are mirror images of one another, and from the right perspective [press middle Re], one side of the keyboard is also a mirror image of the other.

Our pointer, middle, and ring fingers stick up above our thumbs and pinkies, and the keyboard also has keys that stick up above the others.

When you place your fingers that stick up on the keys that stick up, suddenly the whole keyboard becomes a repeating pattern of hand-shaped groups of keys [play symm opposite groups].

This means you can navigate the keyboard by _touch_, rather than always having to look at your hands. And this gives you a very natural keyboard technique, because when your hands have to _feel_ their way around the keys, they find ways to move very efficiently.

- fingers on the top groups. grab, play only those
- add in thumbs. so thumbs & blocks
- then thumbs, 123. top shape
- then move into different shapes.

So here's how it works. you can play in any shape, starting on any note, using just one fingering principle:

you can play in any shape using only one fingering principle
playing this way causes you to develop

The central rule of Shape Fingerings is to align our fingers that stick up (pointer, middle, and ring fingers) with the keys that stick up (groups of 2 and 3 top keys), and then to move our fingers into each shape beginning from this position.

- maybe demo what you're going to be able to do first. then it's more tolerable to go through the rote steps, or to listen to stuff about hands fitting keys, etc.

Steps:

1. just the top keys, all at once, then up and down the kybd. try to feel for it without looking. grab the groups, and your fingers are where they're supposed to be. try to get to where you're playing with the beat, or making up a beat. use the beat as an incentive to hit the notes in time. in fact, get to where you're playing with the beat without looking before moving on. that's a concrete challenge.
2. add in thumbs. make it really distinct: "thumbs, 1, 2, 3, thumbs, 1, 2"
3. move into the 5s, etc.

Start each session with playing, then move into working on the fingerings, and end with playing. This starts to introduce some more technique-like stuff than the previous two lessons, so bookend it with playing. You'll probably notice some of the technique stuff working its way into your playing. I also like how this inverts the usual "warm up, then play" routine of practicing scales.

thinking about these as scales, going all the way up and down, versus as being more local, practicing the fingering, picking up the beat, allowing fingering changes, mistakes, letting it become a guide. less as an exercise, but as a way of feeling more comfortable with the keyboard. that should be the "when am i done" goal.

At first, the feeling that it has to be right, to the feeling that it's not about rightness at all.

in the future, if you keep doing this:
try playing contrary, opposite directions.
then try playing contrary starting on different (unmatched) fingers.
to transition from up/down to contrary, you can make the transition with the same fingerings if it's on a symmetrical note (Pe, Re). But if from any other note, the fingerings diverge, which is a good challenge.

- you'll still get auditory feedback if you play a note that's outside the shape
- reiterate that it's the same fingering for each new shape you add. start with the fingering for the previous shape you know, and then adjust one finger for the next shape. That's a different way to think of it than "start with the basic fingering and move into the shape." Both are good, but different.
