[front cam] Now, as you're playing, you can use any fingers you like. But the keyboard actually _matches_ your hands, and this can really help you out.

[overhead] Our hands [show] are mirror images of one another, and from [the right perspective]() [press middle key], one side of the keyboard is also a mirror image of the other.

Our pointer, middle, and ring fingers [show] stick up above our thumbs and pinkies, and the keyboard also has keys [show] that stick up above the others.

When you place your fingers that stick up on the keys that stick up, suddenly the whole keyboard becomes a repeating pattern of hand-shaped groups of keys [play symm opposite groups].

This gives you a guideline for how your fingers can meet the keys. It helps you navigate the keyboard by touch, rather than having to look at your hands. And this leads to a very natural finger technique, because when you hands have to *feel* their way around, they find the easiest ways to meet the keys.

So here's how it works.





- fingers on the top groups. grab, play only those
  - just the top keys, all at once, then up and down the kybd. try to feel for it without looking. grab the groups, and your fingers are where they're supposed to be. try to get to where you're playing with the beat, or making up a beat. use the beat as an incentive to hit the notes in time. in fact, get to where you're playing with the beat without looking before moving on. that's a concrete challenge.

- add in thumbs. so thumbs & blocks (pull hands away at first)
- then thumbs, 123. top shape
  - add in thumbs. make it really distinct: "thumbs, 1, 2, 3, thumbs, 1, 2"
  - you'll still get auditory feedback if you play a note that's outside the shape

- then move into different shapes (or at least how that *will* work...)
  - **remember, this lesson only needs to deal with the TOP shape**&mdash;the other shapes will be covered through the SR tactile sequence
  - reiterate that it's the same fingering for each new shape you add. start with the fingering for the previous shape you know, and then adjust one finger for the next shape. That's a different way to think of it than "start with the basic fingering and move into the shape." Both are good, but different.
  




So here's how it works. you can play in any shape, starting on any note, using just one fingering principle:

you can play in any shape using only one fingering principle
playing this way causes you to develop



Start each session with playing, then move into working on the fingerings, and end with playing. This starts to introduce some more technique-like stuff than the previous two lessons, so bookend it with playing. You'll probably notice some of the technique stuff working its way into your playing. I also like how this inverts the usual "warm up, then play" routine of practicing scales.

thinking about these as scales, going all the way up and down, versus as being more local, practicing the fingering, picking up the beat, allowing fingering changes, mistakes, letting it become a guide. less as an exercise, but as a way of feeling more comfortable with the keyboard. that should be the "when am i done" goal.

At first, the feeling that it has to be the right fingering, to the feeling that it's not about rightness at all, but a guideline.



in the future, if you keep doing this:

- try playing contrary, opposite directions.
- then try playing contrary starting on different (unmatched) fingers.
- to transition from up/down to contrary, you can make the transition with the same fingerings if it's on a symmetrical note (Pe, Re). But if from any other note, the fingerings diverge, which is a good challenge.
