# Playing With the Anchor

this could be like app lesson 4, imagined structures, pre-notation, focused by the anchor. i like that. in a strange way, it's a precursor to the structured "anchor-higher-lower" entry into a tonescape, and the way that moves into structured movement around a tonescape, and then gradually less structured movement--or rather, that the structuring becomes gradually more internalized. So there's a sort of opposition being set up here, on one hand, a sort of rational structuring, and on the other, an imaginitive unstructuring.



## The Lesson

Part A

The sequence of ideas from the O.G. lesson 4:
  - make up a beat with the anchor note
  - alternate the anchor with a random note of the shape
  - same thing, but play two random notes before coming back to the anchor.
  - start on the anchor and only play every other note of the shape.
  - play the anchor with one hand and any other note of the shape with the other hand at the same time.
  - play the anchor with one hand, and any two notes with the other hand.
  - try combining, expanding these ideas. play two or more notes that skip every other note of the shape.

  Think of some kind of structuring idea in advance and try to use it. That's the point.

try to figure out the melody? i think that's something different. maybe for the second part.



## Things To Think About

- people will start to bring their ideas (like chords) onto this lesson.
- it also sounds more structured. which raises the question of how much of the structure comes from the concept.
- the sense of play is aided by structure.

this also suggests some other ways to read the regions of overlap on the map. "Instruments-Imagination" can mean, as it does here at first, instruments to aid the imagination, but later, it can also become the imagination as an instrument. also, overlaps are spatially opposite to the center of a region--can you say, for example, that the overlap of Symbols and Instruments is polar to the land of Imagination proper?
