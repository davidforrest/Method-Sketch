## Playing With the Anchor



### Transcript

The sequence of ideas from app lesson 4:
  - make up a beat with the anchor note
  - alternate the anchor with a random note of the shape
  - same thing, but play two random notes before coming back to the anchor.
  - start on the anchor and only play every other note of the shape.
  - play the anchor with one hand and any other note of the shape with the other hand at the same time. alternate hands.
  - play the anchor with one hand, and any two notes with the other hand. alternate hands.
  - try combining, expanding these ideas. for example, play two or more notes that skip every other note of the shape.

  Think of some kind of structuring idea in advance and try to use it. Be aware of the relationship of the principle and what results, with the anchor as an organizing principle. That's the point.
