  ### Transcript

  introduces two things: a way to name/notate bass notes, and the idea of pulse

  Start by notating bass notes, dots as events. You still have to remember them to match them with the song, but now you're getting them from the page rather than by watching them played on the keyboard.

  Notes as "x notes above or below the anchor"

  How to notate the groupings / patterns of bass notes? different lines? You're relying on your ear here.

  Then add pulse (abstracted time, the idea of a regular pulse. think about how different this is from the actual events taking place in the music)

  pulse / beat is something abstract and different from bass note.

  passive: some more bass note patterns notated

  active: maybe notate some of the things from Lesson 5 (playing with the anchor)

Other examples

- [Bieber - No Pressure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=154himd-3ZE) (good for chords)
- [Maroon 5 - This Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPpTgCho5ZA) (bass notes land on some pretty unusual anchors. how do those translate to chords? shape might change in the bridge.)

- [Jonas Blue - Rise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btrzs54s1Rc) (single shape, different chord change timings.)
