# Changes

introduce changing shapes and anchors (as distinct from, but indicated by changing note events), and how changes like these are more general (abstract?), and yet sometimes more accessible, than note-level changes. illustrated by the matter of exactly when they change--on the pulse or the event?

and what about changes in the events themselves, for example, on a second listening once the context has changed. that's heavy. but the practical take-away is really something like beginning a foundation for ideas like harmonic rhythm, and song structure, and chords changes... spotting when things change, points of articulation, with notation as the "instrument" to do that.

could we apply these same questions back to the note level? for example, that the note symbol is an abstraction of the sound, it's "onset," etc.

*Importantly* This has to distinguish changes at the key and chord levels. anchors at the key level happen in 4, and anchor changes at the chord level happen in 6 (bass notes), although they're considered as tensions to the anchor. So the synthesis has to happen here. a point of articulation can have a shape change, or an anchor change, or both, and can take place at the chord level, or at the key level.
