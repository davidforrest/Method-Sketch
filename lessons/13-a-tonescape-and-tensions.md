This is a tonescape [play]

If you took all the notes that fit with a song and boiled them down into a soup, played them all at once, a tonescape is what it might sound like.

A tonescape represents all the songs that fit in a particular shape. It's reducing this whole world of songs to an idea. And nothing's moving--it's all the notes at once. A note that "fits" means a note that sounds like you would expect it to. Which suggests an intuition. So a tonescape represents potential, for notes, for songs, and so in a sense, it represents your musical intuition. (briefly introducing the tonescape as the potential notes, making those audible)

And even if it doesn't sound like individual notes at all, you can still have a feeling the anchor [hum], and for the notes that make it up [hum].

Working with a tonescape will help you start to develop those feelings more intentionally. It helps you start to build an internal instrument--an instrumet in your imagination--so that before long, you'll be able to hear any note in any song, know what it is, and be able to work with it.

But you don't have to hear all of the individual notes-- you're really working from a feeling for them, an intuition. It's a complicated sound, so to start getting inside this sound, we'll start by focusing on 3 notes in the tonescape, anchor, higher, lower, and we'll use a little voice that will tell which one it is, like this. [demo ("i think that feels higher...")] 



The recording starts with the anchor so you can get oriented, and then "high and low" are somewhat arbitrary terms. But if you allow yourself to work with them, for example, imagining the notes spatially, they can be helpful.

now, this might be easy or might be challenging. **Orienting yourself to the anchor.** You want to hold on to the anchor. Start from the note you hear, then sing backwards to the anchor. That also places you back at the anchor.

Remember that the anchor is a feeling, with the other tensions pulling toward it. Imagine yourself spatially. Make yourself an image of the anchor at the center, and the other notes on either side. Put yourself at the anchor, and imagine that the note is like a rubber band stretched away, wanting to pull back to where you are. Make a spatial metaphor, where you feel yourself pulling away from, then pulling back to, the anchor

If it feels difficult at first, let go of having to name it, and just listen passively, 'oh, okay, i can hear that that's the anchor." Just listen passively, let it soak in, and that'll be a good way to start getting acclimated.

 If you miss one, pay extra attention for that particular note going forward. See if you can correct it and start to get it right. If you don't know one, just stop and listen to it. Forget trying to name it, just listen to it and let it teach you the sound of that tension.

But also make sure, if you miss or can't hear one, that you're oriented to the anchor.

Practice it just once through, and not more than 15min. but most important is to do it every day. It's like building a muscle, so don't overdo it. Be aware when you start to get tired. 



Leave out?

- the computer voice makes it neutral
- don't worry about memorizing the order of the notes at times.
