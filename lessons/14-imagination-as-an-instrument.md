## Imagination as an Instrument

### Transcript

So we've been listening to notes in the tonescape, but (close your eyes) let's try listening to it alone, and let your mind wander. 

The sound itself isn't changing, but you'll start to hear things changing in it. A throbbing, sparkling, a note poke out, notes running away... some experience of something changing.

So let's try for 30 seconds or so, close your eyes, and pay attention to what you hear. and if you hear something, a note poke out, a sparkling.. try to pay attention to it. just to notice it, or to hold on to it, or move between different things that you hear.

You can also affect this by moving your head side to side, moving a book between your head and the speaker, putting your hands in front of your ears, changing the way the sound waves are hitting your ears, that also changes the sound. Of course this is a different kind of change, an acoustic change in how the physical sound waves hit your ears, but it can give you a way in to hearing some changing sounds to listen for.

[play]

Now, nothing in the sound itself is changing, so anything that's changing is in your perception. This shows us that we all hear something different in the same sound, and in music. We're each having a different experience of the same sound.

And if you don't hear all that much changing, the more you listen, the more the sound will start to open up. It's a pretty complex sound, so by listening to it, you're parsing it. There's a way in which the sound moving is you parsing this complex sound.

So you passively hear all kinds of sounds in the tonescape. But you can also start to (pro)actively control what you hear.

And you can hear individual notes inside of this sound when you focus your attention on them. When you focus on a note, it's almost as though the volume turns up on that note, and down on the other notes. 

Here's a simulation of what it might sound/feel like when you shift your focus between two notes in the tonescape. 

you'll hear two notes alternating, first anchor and higher, then anchor and lower, and when they stop changing, see if you can keep the two notes going in your imagination, moving your attention between two notes. 

[play]

What this is doing, when you focus your attention between those notes, you draw the note out of the tonescape. it's the same thing you have to do in order to hear the note without the tonescape. It's like developing that muscle of being able to focus on a particular note. To pull it out of thin air and imagine it clearly, hear it in your mind's ear, the way you can hear words in your mind's ear without having to say them out loud. And the motion between two pitches makes it easier than trying to focus on only one.

This is getting at an internal mechanism of being able to speak this language of pitches, that's controllable, it's part of a kind of fluency. 

(future talk) So you'll start to be able to hear a note in a song and know what it is, but you'll also be able to hear a note in your imagination and know what it is, and how to work with it, to sing it.

So you can listen to the tonescape alone, and to this demo of what it sounds like to shift your atteniton between two notes. 

Then the listening exercise I'm going to give you is the same as before, but it flips it around, gives you the name first, then plays the pitch, like this [play].

So rather than recognize the note, you have to create the note in your mind's ear, and then you'll hear the note to see if you're right.

As before, you can start by humming, that can be helpful, but the goal is to be able to hear the note without humming.

This is a really amazing and rewarding opportunity to look into how you perceive things, and to get to know how you perceive things, and to get to know that and to build within yourself. To play with how your brain works. It's something musical listening really affords us in an almost tangible way. it's a deeply introspective, amazing experience, so spend time with this and try to be creative and experimental in how you listen, and looking into how you listen.



things going on:

- listening inside of a complex sound. like being able to hear individual pitches in a chord
- or to hear an instrument inside a song. after you've done this a bit, listen to a familiar song and you might start to hear new things in it.
- focus, active listening
- and pitch training. anchor and tensions, which will connect to analytical skills down the road

You can listen on headphones, or on regular speakers, as long as you can hear all the notes. The idea isn't that you hear the sound in extraordinary detail, you want to rely on your imagination to fill in what's important.
