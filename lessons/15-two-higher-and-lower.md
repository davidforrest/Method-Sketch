Once you're comfortable recognizing the anchor, and the notes "higher" and "lower," we'll add the note that's two higher, and the note that's two lower. 

[demo it]

This can be a bit more challenging, but It's the same technique. You want to (spatially imagine) putting yourself at the anchor, and ask, how far away is it from the anchor? it's higher, but how much higher? Really feel it in your body as a tension experience that relaxes to the anchor.

Like before, the exercise starts with the anchor to help you get oriented to the anchor. If you get lost, you can also just listen and wait until you hear another anchor to orient yourself back to it.

Forgetting what the anchor sounds like is the biggest issue. But you don't want to try to "remember" the anchor, you want to *be* at the anchor, to have the feeling of position *at* the anchor. Even if you *can* remember the note, per se, or hear what note it is, that's a different thing. You want to *feel* the position of being at the anchor. Thinking of these as individual notes that you remember, versus as positions that are pulling away from and back to the anchor. The anchor becomes a center of gravity. That creates a feeling that's not inherent in the notes themselves, but in their relationship.

The anchor: the idea that you're creating it actively, rather than, as in music, it's being emphasized by events in the song. So you really have to be intentional about orienting yourself there. To make sure you're feeling this as the anchor.

You can also find the anchor in the tonescape and hum it. It's emphasized, the lowest, middle, and highest note [demo this]. So it's kind of framing the sound: lowest, highest, middle, and it's also slightly louder, more prominent, because there are three of them instead of two of all the other notes.

But if you hum, do that only as a way in, then try to decrease the volume, because otherwise you're listening to the sound of your voice, which could be distracting. The goal is to be able to recognize the notes (and to imagine them) without humming.

And at the end of the tonescape, the notes all disappear one by one, like they're being vacuumed up into silence. It sounds cool, but it's also a way to convince yourself of all the notes that are in there, and the last note will also orient you to the anchor.

Remember, this is like building a muscle, so really try to pay attention to when you get tired, and also to when you do it best. Try to find the right time of day when your focus is right to do this. And also be sensitive to when you're losing concentration, and don't overdo it.



(future talk) Once you've got anchor, 2 higher, and 2 lower, when you think about it, that's already 5 of 7 notes of the shape. So you're already well on your way to building your internal instrument. To translate that to a *real* instrument will be an intellectual step, but you're developing the perception that underlies that.



Reiterate: Practice it just once through, and not more than 15min. but most important is to do it every day. It's like building a muscle, so don't overdo it. Be aware when you start to get tired.
