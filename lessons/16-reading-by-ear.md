## Reading by Ear

Now once you're able to focus on the Anchor, Higher, and Lower in the tonescape, and hear them in your mind's ear, you're ready to move on to Anchor, Two Higher, and Two Lower.

But rather than practicing with a recording that tells you which note to focus on, now we're going to read the notes from music notation. Because now, since you can recognize tensions from the tonescapes passive lessons, you're able to verify yourself.

So the little black triangle, the anchor clef, places the anchor on the middle line of the staff, and then you'll have the anchor, and the notes one and two higher, and one and two lower.

The first notation is stepwise, so each note is only one note higher or lower than the last. And the second notation is random. Try both.

This experience is like reading a book quietly to yourelf in your head. It's getting at a question of what it means to be fluent in music. Part of a cycle of being able hear something, to know what you've heard, and to reproduce it, and also to be able to do that with writing, notation.
