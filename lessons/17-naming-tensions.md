So far in the tonescpe, you've learned to recognize the anchor, one and two higher, and one and two lower. 

So, you have a feeling for each note's distance from the anchor, in terms of how much higher or lower the note is, than the anchor.

But the reason the *anchor* stands out at all, is because it's not only the middle note of the tonescape [hum], but it's also the lowest note [play], and the highest note [play]. 

That means we have three different *versions* of the anchor inside our tonescape. We have our lowest note [play lowest], and then we move through each of the notes in the tonescape [play] until we arrive at another version of the anchor [play middle]. And then we can keep going [play] until we arrive at still another, higher version of the anchor [play highest].

Notes that have this relationship&mdash;of feeling like higher and lower versions of the *same* note&mdash;are called *octaves*. "Octo" is the Ancient Greek and Latin word for "eight," and that's also where we get words like "octopus" (which has eight arms), or "octagon" (which has eight sides), or even "October" (which was the eighth month in the Roman calendar).

In the tonescape, each eighth note has this quality of feeling like a version of the same note. So we have [sing 1-8, 1, 8]. And then again, [higher 1-8, 1, 8].

Note number 1, *and* note number 8 are both versions of the anchor. And this gives us a new way to name our notes, using number degrees that repeat each time we reach an anchor. So we have [sing A, 2nd, 3rd... A]. And then again, [higher A, 2nd, 3rd... A, middle A, lower A].

This means that the note we've been calling "one higher" [hum] is the 2nd, relative to the anchor [sing A, 2nd, A]. And the note we were calling "one lower" [hum] is the 7th, relative to the anchor [sing A, 7th, A].

But now, since we can have versions of each note in different octaves, we can also have different versions of the 2nd and the 7th. For example, we can have a 2nd that's one higher than a *lower* version of the anchor [sing lower 2nd, A]. Or we can have a 7th that's one lower than a *higher* version of the anchor [sing middle 7th, A].

So with the same note in different octaves, we can't quite rely on the feeling of a note being "higher" or "lower" than the anchor in exactly the same way we have been. 

Instead, we have to start feeling the quality of "2nd-ness" or "7th-ness" *independently* of the "highness" or "lowness" of the octave.

Our first tonescape exercise will play just these three notes, the Anchor, 2nd, and 7th, but it'll play them in different octaves, like this [play tonescape and name].

The different octaves can take some getting used to. One thing that helps at first, is to bring each note you hear into your comfortable vocal range. So, hum whichever octave of the anchor is most comfortable for your voice [hum], then hum the 2nd and 7th that are closest to that anchor, like this [sing A, 2nd, A, 7th].

Now, each time you hear a new note, listen for which of those three notes in your comfortable vocal range best matches the notes you hear, and hum it, like this. [play tonescape, hum].

You don't have to name the notes at first, until you feel comfortable humming them. And once you can hum a note, then hum your way back to the anchor to hear which note it is, like this [tonescape, hum, and name].

Once you're comfortale with the 2nd and 7th, the next tonescape exercise adds the 3rd and 6th, which are versions of the notes two higher, and two lower than the anchor. You can do the exact same thing, first humming the note, then humming your way back to the anchor, like this [tonescape, hum, and name].

Before long, you'll start to hear whether each note is an anchor, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, or 6th, regardless of its octave. And you'll also start to recognize this quality without having to hum the note first.

So give it a try. As you're listening, pay attention to what feels most challening for *you*, and experiment to find different techniques for yourself. 

Shen you're comfortable naming each note you hear *without* humming it, that's when you're ready to come back for more.
