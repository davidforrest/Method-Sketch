we've been working with the tonescape, hear the anchor, get oriented, hum the anchor

then change the tonescape.

[lighter tonescape]

creates a different feeling. it's subtle. then

[heavier tonescape]

so we've kept the same anchor, but changed ~~the shape&mdash;~~the collection of notes around the anchor, pulling on the anchor. And this change creates a different feeling, which we'll call a mood.

So if our original tonescape was "neutral," we'll say that this mood [play] is "lighter"

and returning to neutral [play], this mood is "heavier."

(like "higher" and "lower") these names are also somewhat arbitrary, but they help to show a relationship between the different moods.

[show all the moods? ] to really show these relationships.

And each mood is distinct, we can recognize the particular feeling it creates.

So we could make sense of these differences by getting inside each mood and finding differences in the individualn notes that make it up. But before we do that, to start, we're going to keep our attention on the overall mood, and start to recognize the subtle, overall feeling of the neutral, lighter, and heavier moods. without getting inside and thinking about the individual notes that make it up.



And even though the moods change, the feelings of the tensions, the anchor, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 6th will still be there in any mood. So if you got to know the feeling of the third along with the neutral tonescape, you'll still have that feeling of position in the lighter or heavier tonescapes.

So to practice, you'll keep naming tensions (A, 2, 3, 7, 6) as before, but now you'll have the lighter and heavier moods in addition to the neutral mood that you already know. 

You can practice listening to each of these moods, then when you're ready, clicking the "choose randomly" button will start a random one of the three moods. close your eyes and see if you can recognize which mood it is, just by the overall feeling of the mood. Then look to see if you were right, and go on naming the tensions you hear.
