## Reading by Ear Part 2




### Transcript

Now that you can recognize tensions in three different moods, you're ready to start drawing those notes out of the tonescapes yourself.

You can do this using the same two notations as before&mdash;one where each new note is only a note higher or lower than the last, and the other where the notes are in random order.

Except now, you're reading the notes in *three* different tonescapes, one for the neutral, lighter, and heavier moods.

This will start to draw you into the sound a little more, because the collection of notes that makes up each tonescape will be slightly different.

But you can still keep your attention on the *feeling* of the overall mood, and you'll only hear the notes of that particular mood. Because it's difficult, even counterintuitive, to imagine or hum a note that isn't part of the tonescape.

So give it a try. Start by reading the first notation in each different mood to get the feel for moving through its notes one by one.

Then try reading the second notation in each mood as well. Remember to orient yourself to the anchor first, then step through each note between the anchor and the note that's written. Then try to feel each note as a tension to the anchor without having to step through the notes in between.

Once you're comfortable reading in the different moods, click the “choose randomly” button to start a random one of the three moods. Again, close your eyes and see if you can recognize which mood it is, just from the overall feeling of the mood. Then look to see if you were right, and go on reading in that mood.

When you're comfortable recognizing the feeling of each mood, and you can hear the notations inside each of the tonescapes, then come on back for more.
