switch to light/heavy tension names



we've been dealing with the overall feelings of our moods, but now we're going to start getting inside of the different moods. this means getting inside the mode to think about the individual notes that make it up, rather than hearing the mode as a whole

all the notes that are in the tonescape, and then just one of them is changing to create the different moods.

so from the neutral tonescape, when i move to the lighter mood, i'm changing the third, the third gets lighter. [sing: neutral anchor, 2nd, 3rd; then compare lighter. switch between the two thirds.]

and when i get heaver, i'm changing the sixth, the sixth gets heavier. [sing: compare anchor, 7th, 6th, switch between the two sixths].

What it means for a tension to get lighter is that it's stretched a greater distance from the anchor, wider, and the heavier are closer to the anchor (ascending from the anchor, that is).

So there's a relationship between the overall lightness or heaviness of the mood, and the lightness or heaviness of the individual notes that make it up. Making a note inside a mood lighter makes the whole mood lighter (i went from a heavy to a light third). And making a note inside a mood heavier makes the whole mood heavier (i went from a light to a heavy sixth).

In fact, the light/heavy mood represent the  sum of the light/heavy tensions that make them up.

So in the lighter mood, the third and sixth are light. In the heavier, the third and sixth are heavy. And in neutral, the third is heavy and the sixth is light.

To start getting the hang of this, we'll add the light/heavy names of the third and sixth, as a more specific way to name those tensions that are changing to create the differences between our three moods. So now, when you hear a 3rd or 6th, you have to distinguish if it's light or heavy. 





So nothing is changing in the sound of the notes, but only in how we're naming them. We're being more specific in how we name the notes that differ between the moods.

And in fact, the numbers stay the same, whether, say, a 3rd is light or heavy, it still has the feeling of a third. so the number of the tension, its position, order in the overall collection of notes, is something more general than whether it's light or heavy.



(maybe) you'll notice that the note getting "lighter" is two higher than the anchor, and the note getting "heavier" is two lower. This symmetry is because of where we were starting, from the neutral mood, which is made up of an equal number of light and heavy tensions to the anchor. The purpose of doing this is to help you start to recognize an overall structure for the different modes: a spectrum of lightness and heaviness, with neutral in the middle.





When we bring all the tensions into the tonescape (with light/heavy names for the 3rd and 6th), you'll also be able to hear if the tension is "in" or "out" of the tonescape (or if it sounds different from the 3rd or 6th you've been naming so far), which will help distinguish the light/heavy tensions at first. 

then the exercises. the all tensions in neutral will be different, a note really stands out when its not in the tonescape...
