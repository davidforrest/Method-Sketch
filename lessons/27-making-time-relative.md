## Making Time Relative

### Transcript

Add two more pairs of shapes, 3 to the Left & Right, and 2 to the Left & Right.

But let's also make a change to the notation.

You've been playing only on beats where a note is written. And so the beats themselves have been represented by dots, evenly spaced across the staff.

But what happens if you want to play more than one note in the space of one beat? You have a problem!

Either you'd have to squeeze more notes in between the dots, or you'd have to use more than one dot to represent a single beat.

But another option is to use different symbols for the notes themselves, so that the beat is no longer represented by a dot, but instead, by the way the note itself looks.



so say that rather than the dot, we assign our note, the little blue circle, to represent a beat.

and then we add a different note, a blue circle with a stem, to represent half a beat. so that two of the notes with a stem fit in the time of one beat. like this [play].

try reading this first notation along with some songs. And then, you can switch it up, and make the note with a stem represent the beat. Which means that since the note with a stem was half the value of our original note, now the original note represents *two* beats, like this [play].



then we'll add a third note symbol, like our note with a stem, but with the circle filled in, and make *this* note the beat. So now the note with a stem is two beats, and the original circle is four beats, like this [play].

and if you go back to making the original stemmed note the beat, now our new filled in note is half a beat, like this [play]



add one more symbol, with a flag.





leave the dots at first, because when the notes are still evenly spaced, you really have to distinguish the meaning of the different symbols.

but since their meaning has been absorbed into the note symbol, you don't really need them anymore 

then take them away, and you have a little more freedom about how you space the notes. it's a little clearer, even, to group the shorter notes a little more closely together, and give the longer notes some more space.

But it doesn't have to be exact, because now the real meaning of the spacing in time is covered by the note symbols themselves.



(pay attention to where the anchor clef is placed on the staff!)



theoretical digression about beats as an abstraction (an idea that emerges from the music), even spacing as a further abstraction, and rhythmic note symbols as a way of adding more detail/possibility around the idea of the beat.



reading notes:

- challenging sometimes to keep the shape fingering... have to be aware of where the anchor and your thumbs are in the shape!
- skip to a slower song if you need to, or a faster song if you want to
- start by playing through the shape fingering up and down a few times along with the song you're about to read in.
- start having to look ahead while you're still playing the same note
- to keep your place in the notation, notice where you are relative to the anchor, especially notice each time you arrive to the anchor.
- if you lose your place in the notation, you can start at the next anchor. but try to keep going even if you miss a note.
- if you lose the fingering, think of it as a reference, work your way back to it.
- you'll hear interesting rhythms interacting with the song
- and you can notice when you linger on a particular tension, recognize it's sound in relation to the anchor.
