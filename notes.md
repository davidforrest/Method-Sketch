### Lesson 4 - Shape Fingerings

Learn how your hands match the keyboard, and how to play hands together in any shape, beginning on any note, using only one fingering pattern.

- 2009-10 lesson sketch - samurai sword

**Notes**

- in the future, if you keep doing this:

  - try playing contrary, opposite directions.
  - then try playing contrary starting on different (unmatched) fingers.
  - to transition from up/down to contrary, you can make the transition with the same fingerings if it's on a symmetrical note (Pe, Re). But if from any other note, the fingerings diverge, which is a good challenge.

### Lesson 7 - Bass Notes

Hear the notes that give structure to a song.

**References**

- [2021-10-19 Some Bass Notes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p7rA2N2TsbOB-jaAAlw7mo84C_3UjHEv/view?usp=sharing) (video)
- 2021-09-21 Bass Notes Review & Notes in Time w/Nora (Video)

**Notes**

- at this point, try playing on your own without the song, too (?)
    - and reiterate that in L10 changes, sets up L11 all groups which requires some playing on your own.
    - also a kind of "free play" ending to this playing stretch, before moving into tonescapes & tactile reading...

- Introduce bass notes around the anchor. Hear them structuring the song. Use them to create additional structures.
- Look at Lesson 8 Notation alongside this one. They're related.
- Some good bass note songs:

    - I Like It, Enrique Iglesias
    - one minute more, capital cities (easy, two notes)
    - Counting Stars, One Republic (4 notes)
    - New order
    - El Perdedor Enrique Iglesias (2 sections with a connecting section--really good)
- And repeating patterns of bass notes creating sections, song structure. And perhaps the relationship of those patterns to establishing a key-level anchor (the "defining structures" and structure numbers are fields in the db bass notes table...)

### Commentary - Key and Chord Levels

**References**

- devjournal [2022-11-24-Simplify-shape-anchor-bass-note-structure.md](https://github.com/davidforrest/devJournal/blob/main/shapes-backend/2022-11-24-Simplify-shape-anchor-bass-note-structure.md)
  - Shapes is always at the chord level. If you're not at the chord level, you're not really "in" (inside, playing in) a Shape.
  - Shapes is working with chord-level shapes, but key-level anchors. And bass notes, chord notes are tensions. 
  - that's why shape and anchor needed to be separated. Tonal context and tonal center. Because if they weren't, we wouldn't be able to have this global idea, "Shape," that we can play with outside of these more local concerns.
  - ...

**Notes**

- Also: the difference between a bass note (chord-level anchor) and a chord "root." That is, the difference between a chord as expression of a mode, versus voicing of a triadic chord structure.



### Lesson 8 - Matching A Shape

Learn to match a shape with a song on your own.

**References**

- 2009-10 lesson sketch - fitting songs with shapes

**Notes**

- Match a song with a shape on your own. Start by using a diagram, then use adjacent notes to fill in the shape.
- I never quite do matching anchors on your own. How do I account for that?

### Lesson 9 - Notes in Time

Learn to represent bass notes using music notation.

**References**
- 2021-09-21 Bass Notes Review & Notes in Time w/Nora (Video)

**Notes**

- Represent bass notes relative to the anchor using a staff instead of the keyboard. Then add a way to represent time.
- Follows from 6, really
- i'm making an argument to privilege sound--not "warping" the waveform to the grid.
- see Lesson 28: after this notation, in theory, pulse dots would become regularly spaced (generalized away from the sound). Then rhythmic note symbols generalize even further to relationships.
- The wireframe for this lesson has a waveform underlying the notation. This is impossible if the dots are to be evenly spaced. It highlights that the concept of regular pulse, at least as a step en route to notation, is already an abstraction from the sounding events (in real time) that create pulse in the music. This is foreshadowed in Lesson 7 by the question of whether Bass Note events, as markers of change at the chord level, can (or should) be abstracted from the actual moment when they sound in the music, if that moment isn't exactly aligned with a beat.

**Wireframes**

![wireframe](wireframes/9.1.png)



### Lesson 10 - Changes

Play with changing bass notes, anchors, *and* shapes.

**References**

**Notes**

- Introduce changing shapes and anchors. Distinguish changes at the key and chord levels.
- how exactly to do this graphically? two kinds of anchor arrows? the Lesson 10 wireframe is too complicated.
  - the L10 notation comes immediately after the L9 notation for bass notes. So it shouldn't attempt to change the notation of bass notes (as notes) to small anchor arrows. This means it won't represent note events that aren't bass notes.
  - this only becomes an issue (maybe?) if i want to do the tactile SR sequence through changing shapes. then, yes, i would need to move bass notes (as notes) into a chord-level anchor symbol, or into a mode name.
  - i may also consider moving the key level anchor arrow to the middle line rather than the far left of the notation--to the point where the scrolling note is meant to be read in time.
- compare to how this works in single shape w/ changing bass notes (the notation in Level 9, with a single anchor). also how notation shows us both of these levels.
- probably a separate (T)heory writing that relates 9 and 10, and how bass notes can feel like both tensions at a key level and anchors at a chord level.
- Types of changes / example songs:
  - Shape and (key level) Anchor change: Clocks d020hcWA_Wg
  - Anchor change, same shape: Roxanne 3T1c7GkzRQQ
  - Shape change, same anchor: VanJess X9TgbR9BC6Q
  - (all of the above have changing bass notes)

### Lesson 11 - Groups of Shapes

Get to know three additional groups of shapes.

**References**

- 2009-10 lesson sketch - groups of shapes (part 2)

**Notes**

- Marked as (T)heory
- Introduce three other groups of shapes and listen to their qualities. Relate the groups through their common shape names.
- Similar to Lesson 19, where you want to get to know the broader feeling of a group, rather than getting inside it and thinking about its parts. 




### Lesson 12 - Reading by Touch

Begin to sight read music notation at the keyboard.

*Introduce reading up to thumbs (A, 2H, 2L) in T, 5L, 5R (single light/heavy)*

- 2009-10 lesson sketch - a tonescape

**Notes**

- 



### Lesson 15 - Two Higher and Lower

Add two more notes to recognize in a tonescape.

**References**

- 2023_Spring 1_13_15_tonescapes intro

**Notes**

- maybe can't say that the anchor is the lowest, highest, and middle note of the tonescape yet, or that there are three of the anchor and two of every other note, because octave equivalence doesn't happen until lesson 17.
  - but then, i also talk about the notes disappearing one by one at the end of the tonescape. And it's not as though we won't have already played on multi-octave keyboards for a while by this point... so I'll leave it in there and see what happens.




### Commentary - What is a Tonescape?

**References**
- 2020-11-06.2_mgf_tonescapes_overview.mp3

**Notes**

- Include future tonescapes sequence overview (where this goes from here)
  - or maybe it's not the future sequence that matters, but the notion of hearing an entire tonal space at once...

- things going on:

  - listening inside of a complex sound. like being able to hear individual pitches in a chord
  - focus, active listening
  - and pitch training. anchor and tensions, which will connect to analytical skills down the road
  - This is getting at an internal mechanism of being able to speak this language of pitches, that's controllable, it's part of a kind of fluency.
- also a relationship between "thinking v feeling" and how tonescapes enables (or highlights?) this, and the relationship of moods to chord-modes
- future talk
  - So you'll start to be able to hear a note in a song and know what it is, but you'll also be able to hear a note in your imagination and know what it is, and how to work with it, to sing it.
  - Once you've got anchor, 2 higher, and 2 lower, when you think about it, that's already 5 of 7 notes of the shape. So you're already well on your way to building your internal instrument. To translate that to a *real* instrument will be an intellectual step, but you're developing the perception that underlies that.
- "thinking or feeling": From a conversation with Josh after class 23.2.21
  - light/heavy as a framework, then mode names, then "dominant"
  - a superstructure of major/minor corresponding to light/heavy
  - if you reduce it to maj/min, you lose a whole level of nuanced hearing
  - *but then it's not necessarily about hearing everything modally: modes are a way in to hearing chromatic tensions to an anchor, that imply contexts. or even just to hearing nuanced tensions in context
  - the big thing to come out of today was that they wanted the logos, and then could believe they heard differences between the modes. but i set up shapes to try to work with just the feeling. that's a different skill, and it's valuable enough to foreground. it matters
  - josh asked why i don't just play the few notes we're working with in the tonescape. because we want every opportunity to parse the sound, to spend more time with it. And also, to hear the full context matters.

### Commentary - Shape and Standard Notation

**References**

**Notes**

- There's no explicit sequence for the notation system--it's embedded across the other threads:
  - Staff is introduced in Lesson 9 - Notes In Time (Playing & Vocab)
  - used (and developed?) in Lesson 10 - Changes (Chord & Key)
  - Lesson 12+ (in SR Tactile Sequence)...
  - Lesson 16+ (SR Imagery)
- Think about this alongside FR_Music 3 Note Naming Systems
- Today I read the second Invention in the “5 Left” shape, where it’s neither Ab minor (7 flats) or G# minor (5 sharps), but just degrees in the shape, not nameable by letters. That’s a pretty fun way to think about what this notation is up to.
- (from making time relative) theoretical digression about beats as an abstraction (an idea that emerges from the music), even spacing as a further abstraction, and rhythmic note symbols as a way of adding more detail/possibility around the idea of the beat.



### Lesson 27 - Making Time Relative

**Notes**

- 



### Lesson 29 - Mood Notes

(Reading by Ear Part 5)

Draw all the tensions out of all moods.

**References**

**Notes**

- 



### Commentary - Chord-Modes

Learn the standard names for the moods.

**References**

**Notes**

- This is also a place to talk about the structure of the groups of shapes. Especially with the cosmology diagram. The second group sounds "floatier" because it stretches over more of the space.
- There was a thought to put this after 19 - Moods. But that lesson is more about begining to recognize specific moods, whereas chord-modes follow from the combination of Changes (Lesson 10) and Groups of Shapes (Lesson 11).
  - but still, 19 is supposedly the introduction to modes. 
  - also, how does this relate to the Standard Mode Names (commentary?) at Lesson 33?
  - so maybe a bigger question: what's the relationship/timing of thinking of combinations of shapes and anchors as chord-modes, and learning the sounds/feelings of each of those modes (moods) in the tonescapes sequence? isn't this sequence supposed to be linear?
- Merged Chord-Modes (after L11) with "Moods and Modes" here after L29.
- was a lesson, but this is really a commentary. It's probably written. What (if anything) makes it a lesson?
  - maybe call it "Moods and Modes"
  - also how does it relate to the chord-mode commentary after L11?
- from Spring 2023 wk6: the reason for neutral, light, heavy names is to give a kind of structure to the modes. to show their structure. but they have proper names, too.
- also when someone says "minor third" or "major third" they mean the light and heavy third.
  - there's also "perfect," a neutral concept
  - major and minor might be referring to proper names for particular modes
  - but more likely, they're referring to a general lightnes or heaviness of the modes
  - so you're getting "more major" / lighter as you go from dorian, Dominant, Major...
  - and people will say that dorian is a "minor" mode...
  - also a "dorian" third versus a "heavy" third. the first imbues the note with the whole mode. the second generalizes across several modes: dorian, minor, phrygian...
- and "major" and "minor" as ways of describing a general lightness or heavines of modes, versus the major and minor moods themselves.
- "light" and "heavy" vs raised & lowered allow the notes & modes to be their own thing, rather than alterations of some other mode

- The "Lowered 7th," etc. is in terms of whichever mode you're coming from. Dominant doesn't inherently have a "lowered 7th," unless it's in relation to another mode. It does have a "heavy 7th," though, that isn't lowered, per se, but describes a quality of the system of tensions overall.
- why is the dorian mode neutral? 
  - one, chosen because its not major, so bumps you out of those expectations that are hardwired from so much musical experience. if you can hear the different 3rd, it draws you into the sound more
  - but dorian is also actually neutral. three lighter and three heaver tensions in there.
  - part of an argument here that organizes the modes on a spectrum, that shows a kind of overall structure for the system of modes. that's pedagogical.

- 33 (tensions): [Theory: Standard Mode Names]
- Introduce standard(ish) mood names in place of light/heavy names.
- Also account for my funny capitalization practices: "Lydian, Major, Dominant, dorian, minor, phrygian, locrian," based on a supercategory of "Majorness"-as-general-lightness and "minorness"-as-general-heaviness.

- Also name 2nd, 3rd, 4th group moods and relate their light/heavy positions.
- *how does this relate to the chord-mode commentary following Lesson 11? and do i want to keep all standard terminology/concepts in the commentary, not the lessons?



### Lesson 30 - Incidentals

- add 1L/1R and Bottom shapes
- use mood playlists for reading incidentals
- make a notation that jumps around (random-ish). so you start to use the fingering and the incidentals as a snap-back guideline for reading/playing.

**References**

**Notes**

- Notation with incidentals
  - i wish i could have done reversible notations, but the incidental symbols have to be to the left of the note head...
  - you wouldn't have a heavy 5th in a mood with a light 4th. but you might have a light 5th. why, then, wouldn't you call it a heavy 6th instead? are these different departures to the same note outside the shape? or is it a matter of the direction of the line? or... does the choice of incidental say something about the mood (or potential moods) that incidental is implying? how would that relate to saying that the incidental allows you *not* to think in terms of the new mood, and to keep your attention in the context you're already in?
