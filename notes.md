### Commentary - What Is a Shape?

**Location**

- [02-what-is-a-shape.md](writing/02-what-is-a-shape.md)

**References**

- 2023-Spring 4.SO_Mus notes
- 2023-Spring 2.EMP notes

**Notes**

- the last section "What *Is* a Shape?" feels a little long and a little repetitive. At some point, see if you can improve that?
- based on the commentary after Lesson 7 (bass notes), a shape is also distinguished from a key signature in that it always describes the chord level (!) and not the key level, except by coincidence if all the chords are described by the same shape. Which means key signature, like Major or Minor key in functional tonality, is an abstraction from the core experience of playing with shapes. And so the experience is a way of understanding, feeling that distance.



### Lesson 3 - A Group of Shapes

See the shapes as a group, and add a way to name the shapes.

### Lesson 6 - Playing With the Anchor

Use the anchor note to come up with some ideas for playing.

**Location**

- [06-playing-with-the-anchor.md](lessons/06-playing-with-the-anchor.md)

**References**

- 2013-01-27 wireframes lesson 4 script

**Notes**

- This is a way of using the anchor to focus what we play, balancing structured ideas with openness, listening, randomness.



### Commentary - Where Does Structure Come From?

**Location**

**References**

- 2023-Spring 6.EMP notes - Playing With the Anchor

**Notes**

- imagined structures, pre-notation, focused by the anchor.
- in a strange way, it's a precursor to the structured "anchor-higher-lower" entry into a tonescape, and the way that moves into structured movement around a tonescape, and then gradually less structured movement--or rather, that the structuring becomes gradually more internalized.
- So there's a sort of opposition being set up here, on one hand, a sort of rational structuring, and on the other, an imaginitive unstructuring.
- originally, this included trying to figure out the melody. but that seems like a very different activity: figuring out a particular structure, versus focusing on the principles behind a particular structure that results.
- people will start to bring their ideas (like chords) onto this lesson.
- it also sounds more structured. which raises the question of how much of the structure comes from the concept.
- the sense of play is aided by structure.
- this also suggests some other ways to read the regions of overlap on the map. "Instruments-Imagination" can mean, as it does here at first, instruments to aid the imagination, but later, it can also become the imagination as itself an instrument. 
- also, overlaps are spatially opposite to the center of a region--can you say, for example, that the overlap of Symbols and Instruments is somehow polar to the land of Imagination proper?



### Lesson 7 - Bass Notes

Hear the notes that give structure to a song.

**Location**

- [07-bass-notes.md](lessons/07-bass-notes.md)

**References**

- 2021-10-19 Some Bass Notes (video)
- 2021-09-21 Bass Notes Review & Notes in Time w/Nora (Video)

**Notes**

- Introduce bass notes around the anchor. Hear them structuring the song. Use them to create additional structures.
- Look at Lesson 8 Notation alongside this one. They're related.
- Some good bass note songs:

    - I Like It, Enrique Iglesias
    - one minute more, capital cities (easy, two notes)
    - Counting Stars, One Republic (4 notes)
    - New order
    - El Perdedor Enrique Iglesias (2 sections with a connecting section--really good)



### Commentary - Key and Chord Levels

**Location**

**References**

- devjournal [2022-11-24-Simplify-shape-anchor-bass-note-structure.md](https://github.com/davidforrest/devJournal/blob/main/shapes-backend/2022-11-24-Simplify-shape-anchor-bass-note-structure.md)
  - Shapes is always at the chord level. If you're not at the chord level, you're not really "in" (inside, playing in) a Shape.
  - Shapes is working with chord-level shapes, but key-level anchors. And bass notes, chord notes are tensions. 
  - that's why shape and anchor needed to be separated. Tonal context and tonal center. Because if they weren't, we wouldn't be able to have this global idea, "Shape," that we can play with outside of these more local concerns.

**Notes**



### Lesson 8 - Matching A Shape

Learn to match a shape with a song on your own.

**Location**

- [08-matching-a-shape.md](lessons/08-matching-a-shape.md)

**References**

- 2009-10 lesson sketch - fitting songs with shapes

**Notes**

- Match a song with a shape on your own. Start by using a diagram, then use adjacent notes to fill in the shape.



### Lesson 9 - Notes in Time

Learn to represent bass notes using music notation.

**Location**

- [09-notes-in-time.md](lessons/09-notes-in-time.md)

**References**
- 2021-09-21 Bass Notes Review & Notes in Time w/Nora (Video)

**Notes**

- Represent bass notes relative to the anchor using a staff instead of the keyboard. Then add a way to represent time.
- Follows from 6, really
- i'm making an argument to privilege sound--not "warping" the waveform to the grid.
- see Lesson 28: after this notation, in theory, pulse dots would become regularly spaced (generalized away from the sound). Then rhythmic note symbols generalize even further to relationships.
- The wireframe for this lesson has a waveform underlying the notation. This is impossible if the dots are to be evenly spaced. It highlights that the concept of regular pulse, at least as a step en route to notation, is already an abstraction from the sounding events (in real time) that create pulse in the music. This is foreshadowed in Lesson 7 by the question of whether Bass Note events, as markers of change at the chord level, can (or should) be abstracted from the actual moment when they sound in the music, if that moment isn't exactly aligned with a beat.



### Lesson 10 - Changes

Play with changing bass notes, anchors, *and* shapes.

**Location**

- [10-changes.md](lessons/10-changes.md)

**References**

**Notes**

- Introduce changing shapes and anchors. Distinguish changes at the key and chord levels.
- how exactly to do this graphically? two kinds of anchor arrows? the Lesson 10 wireframe is too complicated.
- note: shapes stays at the chord level, but shows how a key level is implied once shapes start changing. 
- compare to how this works in single shape w/ changing bass notes (the notation in Level 9, with a single anchor).
- also: how notation shows us both of these levels.
- probably a separate (T)heory writing that relates 9 and 10, and how bass notes can feel like both tensions at a key level and anchors at a chord level.



### Lesson 11 - Groups of Shapes

Get to know three additional groups of shapes.

**Location**

- [11-groups-of-shapes.md](lessons/11-groups-of-shapes.md)

**References**

- 2009-10 lesson sketch - groups of shapes (part 2)

**Notes**

- Marked as (T)heory
- Introduce three other groups of shapes and listen to their qualities. Relate the groups through their common shape names.
- Similar to Lesson 19, where you want to get to know the broader feeling of a group, rather than getting inside it and thinking about its parts. 
- Could shuffle all modes and try to hear if it's a 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th group mood.



### Commentary - Chord-Modes

**Location**

**References**

**Notes**

- There was a thought to put this after 19 - Moods. But that lesson is more about begining to recognize specific moods, whereas chord-modes follow from the combination of Changes (Lesson 10) and Groups of Shapes (Lesson 11).



### Lesson 12 - Reading by Touch

Begin to sight read music notation at the keyboard.

**Location**

- [12-reading-by-touch.md](lessons/12-reading-by-touch.md)

**References**

- 2020-11-12_mgf_notation_levels.mp3 (uses 2019-05-15 notation repo)
- 2019-05-15 notation (repo)
  - steps from one note through thumb pivot

**Notes**

- Begin SR Tactile sequence through anchor, two higher, two lower, TOP shape only, Pe anchor. which will include a thumb pivot.
- also: this is the first time we use notation for melodies, or for vocab other than bass notes.
- for notation sheets, see:
  - 13.9.12 SR notation levels
  - and 16.12.29 SR notation levels rebuild



### Lesson 13 - A Tonescape and Tensions

Begin to recognize the sounds of individual notes in a tonescape.

**Location**

- [13-a-tonescape-and-tensions.md](lessons/13-a-tonescape-and-tensions.md)

**References**

- 2023-Spring 6.3 notes (telling exactly what notes are in the tonescape seemed helpful&mdash;another question of feeling v logos that comes up in 19 - Moods)
- 2022-03-06_nora_basics_13_tonescapes.wav
- 2020-11-06_mgf_first_tonescapes.mp3
- 2009-10 lesson sketch - a tonescape

**Notes**

- Introduce a tonescape and get into **passive** tensions (anchor-higher-lower)
- the difference between hearing the middle tone as the anchor, rather than the lowest tone (D, rather than CDE) and dorian nudging us outside the engrained major CDE context



### Lesson 14 - Imagination as an Instrument

Begin to draw individual notes out of the tonescape.

**Location**

- [14-imagination-as-an-instrument.md](lessons/14-imagination-as-an-instrument.md)

**References**

- 2022-03-15_nora_basics_14_tonescapes.wav

**Notes**

- Hearing notes inside a tonescape
- Anchor-higher-lower **active**
- And speaking of developing control of what we hear, our next tonescapes is to hear the note *inside* the tonescape. Start by listening to the static sound changing. Then demo the "inside a tonescape," then try the Tonescapes 3 recording. Once you've got that, the two higher and two lower is a sheet of notation, with an anchor clef, that you can flip upside down.



### Lesson 15 - Tensions Part 2

Add two more notes to recognize in a tonescape.

**Location**

**References**

**Notes**

- Add two higher and two lower tensions **passive**



### Commentary - What is a Tonescape?

**Location**

**References**
- 2020-11-06_mgf_first_tonescapes.mp3

**Notes**

- See FR_Music "Introduce Tonescapes"
- Include future tonescapes sequence overview (where this goes from here)



### Lesson 16 - Reading by Ear

Using notation, add two additional notes to draw out of the tonescape.

**Location**

- [16-reading-by-ear.md](lessons/16-reading-by-ear.md)

**References**

**Notes**

- Begin SR Imagery sequence in the netural mood.
- Anchor, two higher, and two lower **active**



### Lesson 17 - Switch To Number Names

Begin to hear notes in any octave as tensions to the anchor.

**Location**

- [17-switch-to-number-names.md](lessons/17-switch-to-number-names.md)

**References**

- 2023-02-11_Lesson_17_audio

**Notes**
- Switch the tensions naming model to 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 6th. Requires octave equivalence.
- Marked as (T)heory, but perhaps not so (T) after all, because equalizing octaves is a skill...
- there's a "more tips" section at the end of the .md file that's not (yet) incorporated into the .html export



### Lesson 18 - Reading by Touch Part 2

Incorporate two additional shapes into your reading at the keyboard.

**Location**

**References**

**Notes**

- Add 5L and 5R shapes to SR tactile sequence.
- Continue with anchor, one and two higher, one and two lower.



### Lesson 19 - Moods

Begin to recognize the different feelings of different tonescapes.

**Location**

- [19-moods.md](lessons/19-moods.md)

**References**

**Notes**

- changing shapes on a single anchor introduces the idea of moods, and their spectrum of lightness/heaviness.
- add the single light and single heavy tonescapes
- anchor, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 6th in neutral, single light & single heavy tonescapes **passive**
- not differentiating the light/heavy names yet places the focus on the overall feeling of the mood, the big-picture sense.
- Also account for my funny capitalization practices: "Lydian, Major, Dominant, dorian, minor, phrygian, locrian," based on a supercategory of "Majorness"-as-general-lightness and "minorness"-as-general-heaviness.



### Commentary - Feeling or Thinking?

**Location**

**References**

**Notes**

- From a conversation with Josh after class 23.2.21
  - light/heavy as a framework, then mode names, then "dominant"
  - a superstructure of major/minor corresponding to light/heavy
  - if you reduce it to maj/min, you lose a whole level of nuanced hearing
  - *but then it's not necessarily about hearing everything modally: modes are a way in to hearing chromatic tensions to an anchor, that imply contexts. or even just to hearing nuanced tensions in context
  - the big thing to come out of today was that they wanted the logos, and then could believe they heard differences between the modes. but i set up shapes to try to work with just the feeling. that's a different skill, and it's valuable enough to foreground. it matters
  - josh asked why i don't just play the few notes we're working with in the tonescape. because we want every opportunity to parse the sound, to spend more time with it. And also, to hear the full context matters.



### Lesson 20 - Reading by Ear Part 2

Draw notes out of two additional tonescapes.

**Location**

**References**

**Notes**

- SR Imagery sequence in neutral, single light, and single heavy moods
- anchor, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 6th.



### Lesson 21 - Light and Heavy Tensions

Listen to the tensions that make one mood feel different from another.

**Location**

**References**

- 2023-Spring 7.2 notes
- 2023-Spring 6.3 notes (possibly helpful here, we got ahead and talked about tension names, the 3rd and 6th changing)

**Notes**

- Marked as (T)heory
- Introduce "light/heavy" tension names as a more specific way to name tensions that vary in different moods.
- *But only use light/heavy names for the tensions that are changing-- the 3rd and 6th. Will add the rest of the names in lesson 24.
- The light/heavy mood names are a sum of their light/heavy tensions
- this means getting inside the individual tensions of the mode, rather than hearing the mode as a whole (may invite analysis of the asymmetry of notes within a mode)
- the tension number becomes something abstracted from the specific tension, which is how letter names (& traditional solfege) will work. This sets up IPs.
- perhaps the names help us focus on the differences between the moods, kind of like the shape names helped us?
- also bring all the tensions into the neutral tonescape. I wasn't going  to do this until lesson 30 (once we have all the modes), but it makes more sense, I think, to build it up gradually. So there are two exercises: shuffling the different modes and naming within them, and naming all the tensions together.
- So now, if it's a 3rd or 6th, you have to distinguish if it's light or heavy. When we bring all the tensions into the tonescape (with light/heavy names for the 3rd and 6th), you'll also be able to hear if the tension is "in" or "out" of the tonescape (or if it sounds different from the 3rd or 6th you've been naming so far), which will help distinguish the light/heavy tensions at first. 



### Lesson 22 - Independent Solfege

Learn to name a note without having to reference any other note.

**Location**

- [22-independent-solfege.md](lessons/22-independent-solfege.md)

**References**

- 2021-12-23 shape solfege experiment (each shape has diatonic names)
- 2011-03-03 Provisional pp. 27-31 Independent Solfege

**Notes**

- Marked as (T)heory
- Introduce independent solfege names & distinguish from relative names.
- names that work kinda the way pointing to a key on the keyboard does.



### Lesson 23 - Reading by Touch Part 3

Sight read all tensions and two additional shapes at the keyboard.

**Location**

- [23-reading-by-touch-3.md](lessons/23-reading-by-touch-3.md)

**References**

**Notes**

- Introduce 4th and 5th to the SR tactile sequence (all tensions)
- Then add 4L and 4R shapes.



### Lesson 24 - Moods and Tensions Together

Add the remaining tensions in three moods.

**Location**

- [24-moods-and-tensions-together.md](lessons/24-moods-and-tensions-together.md)

**References**

**Notes**

- Add 4th and 5th (all diatonic tensions)
- continue using light/heavy names only for tensions in moods thus far (3rds and 6ths)
- bring all tensions & names thus far together in the neutral tonescape.



### Lesson 25 - Getting Inside of Moods

Add two additional moods along with their tensions.

**Location**

- [25-getting-inside-of-moods.md](lessons/25-getting-inside-of-moods.md)

**References**

**Notes**

- Add double light & double heavy tonescapes, shuffle all.
- Add light 7th and heavy 2nd

### Lesson 26 - Reading by Ear Part 3

Draw all the tensions out of the tonescape, and add two additional moods.

**Location**

**References**

**Notes**

- SR Imagery sequence through double light & heavy moods
- All diatonic tensions



### Lesson 27 - Incidentals

Learn how to notate tensions outside of the shape.

**Location**

**References**

**Notes**

- Marked as (T)heory
- Introduce incidentals as a way of notating tensions outside of the shape (or mood?).
- "light / heavy" or "up, down, return-to" names are a way of abstracting the function of accidentals from a particular diatonic context. in this way, they pair with independent solfege.



### Commentary - Shape and Standard Notation

**Location**

**References**

**Notes**

- There's no explicit sequence for the notation system--it's embedded across the other threads:
  - Staff is introduced in Lesson 9 - Notes In Time (Playing & Vocab)
  - used (and developed?) in Lesson 10 - Changes (Chord & Key)
  - Lesson 12+ (in SR Tactile Sequence)...
  - Lesson 16+ (SR Imagery)
- Think about this alongside FR_Music 3 Note Naming Systems



### Lesson 28 - Making Time Relative

Add rhythmic note values to your reading at the keyboard.

**Location**

**References**

**Notes**

- Marked as (T)heory
- Introduce rhythmic note symbols as subdivisions
- Align different subdivisions with pulse dots, what looks best?



### Lesson 29 - Reading by Touch Part 4

Incorporate two additional shapes into your reading at the keyboard.

**Location**

**References**

**Notes**

- Add 3L and 3R shapes to the SR tactile sequence.
- Continue all tensions, with rhythmic note symbols.

**Location**

**References**

**Notes**

- Introduce standard(ish) mood names in place of light/heavy names.
- Also name 2nd, 3rd, 4th group moods and relate their light/heavy positions.
- *how does this relate to the chord-mode commentary following Lesson 11? and do i want to keep all standard terminology/concepts in the commentary, not the lessons?



### Lesson 33 - Reading by Touch Part 5

Incorporate all the shapes into your reading at the keyboard.

**Location**

**References**

**Notes**

- Add remaining (2L/R, 1L/R, B) shapes to the SR tactile sequence.
