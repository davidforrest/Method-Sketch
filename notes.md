### Lesson 1 - A Shape

Use a single shape to play along with a playlist of songs. Hear when notes fit or don't fit, and start to follow your musical intuition.

### Lesson 4 - Shape Fingerings

Learn how your hands match the keyboard, and how to play hands together in any shape, beginning on any note, using only one fingering pattern.

- 2009-10 lesson sketch - samurai sword

**Notes**

- in the future, if you keep doing this:

  - try playing contrary, opposite directions.
  - then try playing contrary starting on different (unmatched) fingers.
  - to transition from up/down to contrary, you can make the transition with the same fingerings if it's on a symmetrical note (Pe, Re). But if from any other note, the fingerings diverge, which is a good challenge.

### Lesson 10 - Changes

Play with changing bass notes, anchors, *and* shapes.

**References**

- 

**Notes**

- graphically

  - in a changing shape, the new shape wants to align with the leftmost edge of the note that signals the change. or if no note, the center of the pulse dot. who'd'a thunk.
  - but if there's also an anchor change, the shape aligns with the anchor clef, preceding the first pulse where the change takes place.
  - i may also consider moving the key level anchor arrow to the middle line rather than the far left of the notation--to the point where the scrolling note is meant to be read in time.
  - to more closely match a paper-based notation, changing shapes and anchors would scroll in from the right. but it's still different to have the current shape/anchor in the middle of the staff rather than at the left.

### Lesson 14 - Imagination as an Instrument

Begin to draw individual notes out of the tonescape.

**Notes**

- 



### Lesson 15 - Two Higher and Lower

Add two more notes to recognize in a tonescape.

**References**

- 2023_Spring 1_13_15_tonescapes intro

**Notes**

- maybe can't say that the anchor is the lowest, highest, and middle note of the tonescape yet, or that there are three of the anchor and two of every other note, because octave equivalence doesn't happen until lesson 17.
  - but then, i also talk about the notes disappearing one by one at the end of the tonescape. And it's not as though we won't have already played on multi-octave keyboards for a while by this point... so I'll leave it in there and see what happens.

**References**

**Notes**

### Lesson 30 - Incidentals

- add 1L/1R and Bottom shapes
- use mood playlists for reading incidentals
- make a notation that jumps around (random-ish). so you start to use the fingering and the incidentals as a snap-back guideline for reading/playing.

**References**

- 

**Notes**

- you wouldn't have a heavy 5th in a mood with a light 4th. but you might have a light 5th. why, then, wouldn't you call it a heavy 6th instead? are these different departures to the same note outside the shape? or is it a matter of the direction of the line? or... does the choice of incidental say something about the mood (or potential moods) that incidental is implying? how would that relate to saying that the incidental allows you *not* to think in terms of the new mood, and to keep your attention in the context you're already in?
