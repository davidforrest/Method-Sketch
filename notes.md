### Commentary: What Is a Shape?

**References**

- 2023-Spring 4.SO_Mus notes
- 2023-Spring 2.EMP notes

**Notes**

- the last section "What *Is* a Shape?" feels a little long and a little repetitive. At some point, see if you can improve that?
- based on the commentary after Lesson 7 (bass notes), a shape is also distinguished from a key signature in that it always describes the chord level (!) and not the key level, except by coincidence if all the chords are described by the same shape. Which means key signature, like Major or Minor key in functional tonality, is an abstraction from the core experience of playing with shapes. And so the experience is a way of understanding, feeling that distance.

- This is a way of using the anchor to focus what we play, balancing structured ideas with openness, listening, randomness.



### Commentary: Where Does Structure Come From?

**Location**

**References**

- 2023-Spring 6.EMP notes - Playing With the Anchor

**Notes**

- imagined structures, pre-notation, focused by the anchor.
- in a strange way, it's a precursor to the structured "anchor-higher-lower" entry into a tonescape, and the way that moves into structured movement around a tonescape, and then gradually less structured movement--or rather, that the structuring becomes gradually more internalized.
- So there's a sort of opposition being set up here, on one hand, a sort of rational structuring, and on the other, an imaginitive unstructuring.
- originally, this included trying to figure out the melody. but that seems like a very different activity: figuring out a particular structure, versus focusing on the principles behind a particular structure that results.
- people will start to bring their ideas (like chords) onto this lesson.
- it also sounds more structured. which raises the question of how much of the structure comes from the concept.
- the sense of play is aided by structure.
- this also suggests some other ways to read the regions of overlap on the map. "Instruments-Imagination" can mean, as it does here at first, instruments to aid the imagination, but later, it can also become the imagination as itself an instrument. 
- also, overlaps are spatially opposite to the center of a region--can you say, for example, that the overlap of Symbols and Instruments is somehow polar to the land of Imagination proper?

    - one minute more, capital cities (easy, two notes)
    - Counting Stars, One Republic (4 notes)

### Commentary: Key and Chord Levels

  - Shapes is always at the chord level. If you're not at the chord level, you're not really "in" (inside, playing in) a Shape.
  - Shapes is working with chord-level shapes, but key-level anchors. And bass notes, chord notes are tensions. 
  - that's why shape and anchor needed to be separated. Tonal context and tonal center. Because if they weren't, we wouldn't be able to have this global idea, "Shape," that we can play with outside of these more local concerns.

### Lesson 9 - Notes in Time

**Location**

- [09-notes-in-time.md](lessons/09-notes-in-time.md)

**References**
- 2021-09-21 Bass Notes Review & Notes in Time w/Nora (Video)

**Notes**

- The wireframe for this lesson has a waveform underlying the notation. This is impossible if the dots are to be evenly spaced. It highlights that the concept of regular pulse, at least as a step en route to notation, is already an abstraction from the sounding events (in real time) that create pulse in the music. This is foreshadowed in Lesson 7 by the question of whether Bass Note events, as markers of change at the chord level, can (or should) be abstracted from the actual moment when they sound in the music, if that moment isn't exactly aligned with a beat.

### Lesson 11 - Groups of Shapes

**Location**

- [11-groups-of-shapes.md](lessons/11-groups-of-shapes.md)

**References**

- 2009-10 lesson sketch - groups of shapes (part 2)

**Notes**

- Similar to Lesson 19, where you want to get to know the broader feeling of a group, rather than getting inside it and thinking about its parts. 
- Could shuffle all modes and try to hear if it's a 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th group mood.



### Commentary: Chord-Modes

**Location**

**References**

**Notes**

- There was a thought to put this after 19 - Moods. But that lesson is more about begining to recognize specific moods, whereas chord-modes follow from the combination of Changes (Lesson 10) and Groups of Shapes (Lesson 11).

- 2020-11-06_mgf_first_tonescapes.mp3
- 2009-10 lesson sketch - a tonescape

**Notes**

- the difference between hearing the middle tone as the anchor, rather than the lowest tone (D, rather than CDE) and dorian nudging us outside the engrained major CDE context



### Lesson 14 - Imagination as an Instrument

**Location**

- [14-imagination-as-an-instrument.md](lessons/14-imagination-as-an-instrument.md)

**References**

- 2022-03-15_nora_basics_14_tonescapes.wav

**Notes**

- And speaking of developing control of what we hear, our next tonescapes is to hear the note *inside* the tonescape. Start by listening to the static sound changing. Then demo the "inside a tonescape," then try the Tonescapes 3 recording. Once you've got that, the two higher and two lower is a sheet of notation, with an anchor clef, that you can flip upside down.

- [19-moods.md](lessons/19-moods.md)

**References**

**Notes**

- Also account for my funny capitalization practices: "Lydian, Major, Dominant, dorian, minor, phrygian, locrian," based on a supercategory of "Majorness"-as-general-lightness and "minorness"-as-general-heaviness.



### Commentary: Feeling or Thinking?

**Location**

**References**

**Notes**

- From a conversation with Josh after class 23.2.21
  - light/heavy as a framework, then mode names, then "dominant"
  - a superstructure of major/minor corresponding to light/heavy
  - if you reduce it to maj/min, you lose a whole level of nuanced hearing
  - *but then it's not necessarily about hearing everything modally: modes are a way in to hearing chromatic tensions to an anchor, that imply contexts. or even just to hearing nuanced tensions in context
  - the big thing to come out of today was that they wanted the logos, and then could believe they heard differences between the modes. but i set up shapes to try to work with just the feeling. that's a different skill, and it's valuable enough to foreground. it matters
  - josh asked why i don't just play the few notes we're working with in the tonescape. because we want every opportunity to parse the sound, to spend more time with it. And also, to hear the full context matters.



### Lesson 20

### Lesson 21 - Light and Heavy Tensions

**Location**

**References**

- 2023-Spring 7.2 notes
- 2023-Spring 6.3 notes (possibly helpful here, we got ahead and talked about tension names, the 3rd and 6th changing)

**Notes**

- So now, if it's a 3rd or 6th, you have to distinguish if it's light or heavy. When we bring all the tensions into the tonescape (with light/heavy names for the 3rd and 6th), you'll also be able to hear if the tension is "in" or "out" of the tonescape (or if it sounds different from the 3rd or 6th you've been naming so far), which will help distinguish the light/heavy tensions at first.
