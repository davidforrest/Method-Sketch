### Path Outline

Start &#8674;
Thinking Music Theory Anew

> To introduce the approach and preempt questions like "where are the note names?" or "aren't you just drawing scales on the piano..." etc.

&#8674; Imagination-Symbols
Playing With the World

> The notion of a group of notes fitting with a song. "fit" and "don't fit," as floating dots. Also the matters of the songs as the world, and the "fit" as a kind of tacit knowledge to leverage.

> Interesting to think what it means to draw out this particular aspect of a tacit relationship with the world, and to be able to play around with it. this both separates us from the world, and brings us closer. it's a sort of scientific discovery, a potential to modify the world, or to inquire into it...

&#8674; Symbols
Widening the Scope

> The matter of that same group fitting with lots of songs, then reconfiguring the in/out groups to fit with any (single-group) song. so here we can see, for one, how lots of apps etc work. we can also get the sense that there's something common to all these groups, at least that in each case, seven notes seem to fit and five don't, but we *can't see the pattern with this kind of diagram*. so we can invent a different way to represent this idea.

> mapping dots to a shape on the keyboard. here you can still see which notes "fit" and "don't fit," and the group now has a distinctive contour. from there we can look at a system of shapes--to answer the question, "so how many groupings are there?" and this gives us a much different feeling of orientation. we're not in the weeds of the floating dots anymore, but standing back and able to reflect on something much larger.

> a third layer, this will involve naming the shapes. so you can recognize that the shape itself can be a symbol for the grouping, and then at a higher level of abstraction, a verbal description of the symbol, which, in theory, you could also use to describe the pre-shape grouping of notes. and these all depend on each other, and assist each other--the names, for example, describe the shape spatially and numerically, which makes it easier to remember, and to describe as a system.

&#8674; Symbols-Instruments
Connecting With a Tradition

> apply this. it's not just a cool insight, but now you can improvise with any of these songs. it connects you (your intuition) via a symbol (the shape) to the musical world around you. To a community, both now, and in the past. that ought to feel profound.

> [Pre-instrument reflection](world/pre-instrument-reflection.md).

&#8674; Instruments
Shape Fingerings

> and now we're into Instrument territory. why not introduce the physical correspondence, symmetry, and basic shape fingering? you can start on any note, and use the same fingering for any shape. show the top shape fingering and the rule, but suggest branching outward gradually. touch on what this accomplishes in terms of connecting your body to the instrument. and also what it represents (the interface-body relationship) that you could apply to thinking about other instruments--to instruments generally. not to mention diagrams.

&#8674; Instruments-Imagination
The Anchor Note

> this is time to introduce the idea of the anchor note. it's also a kind of tacit knowledge, but not necessarily as clearly as the grouping was. it's something that you can draw out, and develop with the help of an instrument. (and remember here that an instrument is no longer separable from a symbol, a constructed idea).

> the goal here is to introduce the anchor by demonstration--but guessing at it first could be interesting. different people will have different "right" answers, much moreso than for shapes. this is the beginning of *training* ourselves to hear anchors in a more consistent way, which will evolve indirectly by way of training tensions, all of which relies on a very specific theoretical construction of these ideas. this, at least, is a reason to emphasize "anchor" as a theoretical ingredient distinct from "shape."

&#8674; Imagination
Structured Invention

> this could be like app lesson 4, imagined structures, pre-notation, focused by the anchor. i like that. in a strange way, it's a precursor to the structured "anchor-higher-lower" entry into a tonescape, and the way that moves into structured movement around a tonescape, and then gradually less structured movement--or rather, that the structuring becomes gradually more internalized. So there's a sort of opposition being set up here, on one hand, a sort of rational structuring, and on the other, an imaginitive unstructuring.

> extend this also to introduce changing bass notes. they are structured around the anchor, but then they provide the structure for imagined voicings. this is the idea of a chord (not to mention the very beginning of the idea of function, a higher order relationship of bass notes to the song's anchor note). playing any voicings of the shape, along with the changing bass notes, begins to sound distinctively like the song, though not in the usual melodic sense.

> this also suggests some other ways to read the regions of overlap. "Instruments-Imagination" can mean, as it does here at first, instruments to aid the imagination, but later, it can also become the imagination as an instrument. also, overlaps are spatially opposite to the center of a region--can you say, for example, that the overlap of Symbols and Instruments is polar to the land of Imagination proper?

&#8674; Imagination-Symbols
Matching a Shape

> matching a single shape can start by using the diagram as a matching tool (symbol), and evolve to a note-by-note approach (imagination) that only references the idea of the grouping.

&#8674; Symbols
Capturing Events in Time

> here will be the place to introduce positional shape notation--a way to capture those structures from imagination-symbols, but only in terms of a succession of events.

> then add abstracted time, the idea of a regular pulse. think about how different this is from the actual events taking place in the music, why it belongs squarely in the land of symbols, and what that suggests about symbols more generally.

> does notation require a notion of time, and what different approaches to and representations of time are possible? think of a scrolling display versus symbolic rhythmic notation.

&#8674; Symbols-Instruments
When Things Change

> introduce changing shapes and anchors (as distinct from, but indicated by changing note events), and how changes like these are more general (abstract?), and yet sometimes more accessible, than note-level changes. illustrated by the matter of exactly when they change--on the pulse or the event?

> and what about changes in the events themselves, for example, on a second listening once the context has changed. that's heavy. but the practical take-away is really something like beginning a foundation for ideas like harmonic rhythm, and song structure, and chords changes... spotting when things change, points of articulation, with notation as the "instrument" to do that.

> could we apply these same questions back to the note level? for example, that the note symbol is an abstraction of the sound, it's "onset," etc.

&#8674; Instruments
The Feeling of Fluency

> notation-pulse-fingering (begin the sight reading sequence). this is the matter, and feeling of fluent reading, and there's a physical, instrumental aspect to that.

> here, since we have shape, anchor, and pulse established, could also be a digression on harmonic mixing in a DJ set. That requires pulse, although pulse wouldn't be the focus.

> go through anchor, two higher, two lower. which will include a thumb pivot.

&#8674; Instruments-Imagination
Imagination as an Instrument

> get into passive tonescapes (anchor-higher-lower), as the matter of how to know exactly which notes you're hearing. this is the transition from "instruments to aid the imagination" to "the imagination as an instrument.

> introduce and derive a tonescape (that sound in the background) from events moving in a song. This is truly an "instrument to aid the imagination," abstracted from the physical instrument in a different way than a symbol is.

&#8674; Imagination
Playing Your Mind's Ear

> active anchor-higher-lower. this is actually, concretely starting to play your imagination as an instrument by directing your attention. a precursor to playing your mind's ear. trippy.

> add two higher, two lower, passive and then active.

&#8674; Imagination-Symbols
Reading Without an Instrument

> switch the naming model to anchor, 2nd, 3rd; anchor, 7th, 6th. a new mental model, symbol system.

> the sight reading activity, but using active tonescapes instead of a physical instrument. anchor, two higher and two lower.

&#8674; Symbols
...

> introduce mood names: "neutral, single light, single heavy" (this and the numbers are transposable, relative symbol systems).

> show that you retain your tonescape tensions in these different moods

> also hear these different moods in some example songs, and name note events in a song as tensions in a mood. all this is about things that generalize: the tonal version of the abstraction set up by time in the last pass through Symbols.

&#8674; Symbols-Instruments

> introduce indepsol names (things that don't transpose), as the symbol equivalent of a distinctive key on the keyboard.

&#8674; Instruments

> add 4ths and 5ths to the tactile reading, so now you're working with all tensions in a mood.

> also move into different shapes: top, 5s, 4s. play with all these songs.

&#8674; Instruments-Imagination

> add 4th and 5th passive tonescapes. hearing all tensions in a mood. then bring in single light and single heavy in addition to neutral.

&#8674; Imagination

> all tensions active in a neutral tonescape. then free play in a tonescape: neutral, single light, single heavy.

&#8674; Imagination-Symbols

> all tensions and free play, add double light and double heavy

> pick some structures out of songs, like changing bass notes, or some melodies.
