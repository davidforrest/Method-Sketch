# A Shape

## Lesson Script

So my favorite way to get started with Shapes is with a playlist of current songs, and a single shape.

[open the playlist]

You can find this playlist linked in the resources for this lesson. It's a kind of fun, random snapshot of music at large, of songs you might encounter just as a person living in the world right now. So it's not organized by style or anything like that.

And this thing in the middle here is a shape. It's two strokes drawn over a keyboard.

So here's how a shape works.

Imagine you have a bunch of notes floating in the air.
And then you map those notes onto keys of the keyboard.
You can draw lines that connect them together,
and then the lines themselves become a way to represent all those notes.

and so you can remember the shape very quickly, this little stroke, and then this kind of rainbow looking stroke.

If I play these notes on the keyboard, it's these two
[play]
and then the rainbow.

OK, so back to the song.
[unmute]

Now, you can play the notes in any order, or any combination, and they're going to sound like they fit with the song. You can also use any fingers you like.

[play, just one finger]

and if i play any notes that *aren't* in the shape, they sound pretty different, they don't fit.
[play]
But the notes in the shape do, in any order, and any combination.
[play]

So give it a shot. Try using the shape to play along with a song. And if you don't like the song that's playing, you can hit "try another" until you get one that catches your interest.

This is very open-ended, but you'll find that you have some intuition about what to play just because of all the music you already listen to. A really good guideline is to try playing as though you're adding a new layer to the song, something that sounds good to you.

So you're not necessarily trying to play *the song* or *the melody*, its more that you're letting yourself become a part of the music, you're participating and adding something to it.

So I'll give you just a couple more tips before I leave you to it.

If you have any trouble hearing how the shape fits with a song, try playing some of the notes that *aren't* in the shape, and listen to the difference. This can really help you hear the fit, and you'll also hear very clearly if you accidentally play a note that isn't in the shape.

Also, don't be afraid to play with songs you don't know, or that are very different from what you usually like to listen to. When you play the same shape with lots of different songs, you start to get a broader sense of how a shape works, you get more variation in your playing, and you stretch the experience much further.

And finally, how to know you've "got it" and are ready to move on? I'd sat at a minimum, try finding 3 songs in the playlist that you like, play through the length of the whole song, and really let yourself get into it. From there, you could keep going, or stop, but ask yourself if you feel comfortable playing with the shape, and when you do, that's when you're ready to move on.

## Some More to Think About

### How do I know I'm doing it right?
Yes.

---

### Is the shape a scale?
The way to think of a shape is an idea that underlies all the things, scale, chord, etc-- it's a little more zoomed out. So from a shape, you could derive a scale, you could derive chords, you could derive modes, key signatures, the structure of the notation system... but something common to all those things is this pool of notes that sounds like it fits together. So if you decide to play them in order, you have a scale or a mode. But if you decide to play them as a random cluster, you get a fat-sounding chord. Or you could do something else. The healthiest way to think of a shape is not-yet-a-scale, not-yet-a-mode... but with the potential to become any of those things.

- nora's first question: "how does this relate to chords?" which was really to say "why does this work?" my answer was, first that this method is my way of answering that question. because otherwise you have to define the terms. but the notes of a shape are a collection of notes that you can use to describe the physics stuff, or keys, or chords, or any number of other concepts, like a lowest common denominator. Also that the collection of notes in the key and chord levels overlap in these songs--it's a curated playlist, although it's also the norm. So it doesn't work because of chords, scales, keys, etc., but it is common to all those things, and so it's a way to derive those things, and also to get at other things.

### Is this real music?
preempt questions like "where are the note names?" or "aren't you just drawing scales on the piano..." etc.

### Songs as the world
A hyper-real snapshot of the present moment, perhaps with one foot in the future.

- and the style/genre thing. most of the time you're not getting to play this style of music.

---

### Notes that Fit  
The notion of a group of notes fitting with a song, and the "fit" as a kind of tacit knowledge to leverage.

### One of infinite aspects
Interesting to think what it means to draw out this particular aspect of a tacit relationship with the world, and to be able to play around with it. this both separates us from the world, and brings us closer. it's a sort of scientific discovery, a potential to modify the world, or to inquire into it...

- my theory goal was, i think, to show that we have knowledge in music already, in all kinds of domains, and that we're accessing and formalizing that knowledge with a tool, the shape. We could do this with infinite domains. But the purpose of choosing this particular domain is the way it lines up with all the concepts in the tradition we trust--the things we think we want to learn. chords, keys, notation, etc.
