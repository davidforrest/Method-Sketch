# A Shape

## Summary

Use a shape to play along with a playlist of songs. Hear when notes fit and don't fit. Start to follow your musical instincts.

## The Lesson

Here's a current playlist, a snapshot of the world.

And here's how to read a shape.

## Things To Think About

### Songs as the world
A hyper-real snapshot of the present moment, perhaps with one foot in the future.

### Notes that Fit  
The notion of a group of notes fitting with a song, and the "fit" as a kind of tacit knowledge to leverage.


### One of infinite aspects
Interesting to think what it means to draw out this particular aspect of a tacit relationship with the world, and to be able to play around with it. this both separates us from the world, and brings us closer. it's a sort of scientific discovery, a potential to modify the world, or to inquire into it...

### Is this real music?
preempt questions like "where are the note names?" or "aren't you just drawing scales on the piano..." etc.

### Some Notes
- cool, it gets your fingers working tactilly
- it's a different way of interacting with songs. not singing, not dancing along.
- hearing the same idea over lots of different songs--creates a field. you start to get a sense of how it works, you stretch in different ways.
- the goal is to try to add something that you like to the song. that sounds good to you.
- nora's first question: "how does this relate to chords?" which was really to say "why does this work?" my answer was, first that this method is my way of answering that question. because otherwise you have to define the terms. but the notes of a shape are a collection of notes that you can use to describe the physics stuff, or keys, or chords, or any number of other concepts, like a lowest common denominator. Also that the collection of notes in the key and chord levels overlap in these songs--it's a curated playlist, although it's also the norm. So it doesn't work because of chords, scales, keys, etc., but it is common to all those things, and so it's a way to derive those things, and also to get at other things.
- my theory goal was, i think, to show that we have knowledge in music already, in all kinds of domains, and that we're accessing and formalizing that knowledge with a tool, the shape. We could do this with infinite domains. But the purpose of choosing this particular domain is the way it lines up with all the concepts in the tradition we trust--the things we think we want to learn. chords, keys, notation, etc.
- permission. that this is at least possible.
- and on a piano. it's not supposed to be an easy instrument. or it's the everything instrument.
- and the style/genre thing. most of the time you're not getting to play this style of music.
- highlights a muscular element to playing.
