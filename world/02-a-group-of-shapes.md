# A Group of Shapes


## Lesson Script

  [front cam]   
  So now I want to take you to a new version of the playlist, and it's linked in the resources for this lesson.  
  [show the playlist]  
  In this playlist, when you switch songs, you're going to get some different shapes.  
  [flip through, land on a 2 or 5 shape, 2R or 5L ideally]  
  All of these shapes work just like the shape you already played with. Except, of course, they're made up of different notes.  
  So the notes in *this* shape are...  
  [outline the shape and play with one finger]  
  [...]
  If I choose a different one  
  [switch song]  
  here, the notes are...  
  [outline and play with one finger]  
  [...]  
  So try a couple of these yourself. Find a song you like that has a new shape, then get the notes down and then try playing along with the song, just like you did before.  
  [try it]  
  [...]
  [front cam] You can remember any one of these shapes pretty much right away, and then you can think of the *shape* rather than having to remember each of the individual notes that make it up.  
  So go ahead and pause this video, and play around with these new shapes a little bit. You'll get to know the shapes gradually just by playing with them, so when each new shape that pops up starts to feel like it's one you've maybe seen before, that's when you're ready to come back for the rest of this lesson.  
  [pause]  
  So while you were playing, eventually some of the shapes start to feel familiar. It's like ok, I've already played with this one, or I've seen that one, and you also start to pick up on similarities between some of the shapes.  
  One question that might come up while you're doing this is, how many shapes are there? Are there, like, a hundred different shapes, or is this something I can actually wrap my head around?  
  So I want to show you a whole group of shapes, all at once.  
  [ultralite diagram]  
  These are all of the shapes you're going to see in this playlist.  
  And here's how you read this group: if a pair of strokes are right next to each other, like these [point to an example],  
  or these, [another example]  
  then they get to be a shape.  
  But if they're not right next to each other, like these [point to an example],  
  or these [the shape in the middle],  
  then they don't get to be a shape.  
  So the first shape we played with was this pair in the middle  
  [point to the TOP shape]  
  And shape for the song that's playing right now is here [point to that shape]  
  Also notice how the whole group is symmetrical, so for each shape on one side, there's a shape that's its mirror image on the other side.  
  [point]  
  And that symmetry makes the shapes even easier to remember, because if you know one shape, you can think of its opposite and then you know two shapes instead of just one.  
  [front cam]  
  Now, I think it's pretty cool to be able to play without necessarily having to name any of these shapes, or having to name any of the notes that make them up.  
  Because in a way, the keyboard itself, and the contour of the shape, already works as a kind of name. What note is it?  
  [keyboard view]  
  It's *this* note [point]. What shape is it? Well, it's the shape that goes like this  
  [draw the stroke on the keyboard with your finger].  
  But when it comes to a group of shapes, having names can help us out.  
  Here's how shape names. The keyboard has keys that stick up, the "top" keys, and keys that don't stick up, the "bottom" keys.  
  You can name any shape by its number of top keys, and whether they're on the right or left side of the shape.  
  [point to 1R]  
  So this pair right here, it has one top key [point], and it's on the right side of the shape, so it's called "1 to the Right."  
  And then this pair over here, its opposite, would be "1 to the Left."  
  [point to 2L]  
  Then this pair, it has one, *two* top keys, and they're on the left of the shape, so it's called "2 to the Left."  
  So there's 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 to the left  
  [point]  
  and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to the right  
  [point]  
  The shape in the middle is called the "TOP" shape [point], centered on the top keys, and the one on the end is the "bottom" shape, because it uses all the bottom keys [point]. The bottom shape repeats on both ends of the group because the whole group sort of wraps around on itself.  
  [playlist] So if I go back to the playlist and look at the shape that's playing, let's see, it has how many top keys?  
  [count, (3)]  
  And they're on the (right) of the shape, so it's "(3 to the right)."  
  [switch songs] This one has [count, x] top keys  
  and they're on the _ _ _, so it's called "_ _ _ ".  
  [switch again] And this one has [count, x] top keys  
  and they're on the _ _ _ , so it's called "_ _ _ ".  
  So give this a try yourself. Play along with some different songs, just like you were doing before, but now when a new shape comes up, name it for yourself first. Like, oh this is "2 to the Left," and *then* play with it.  
  [front cam] When you name a shape, pay attention to how the name describes the contour of the shape, and it also gives you the shape's position within the larger group. So you start to get a feeling for how that shape is related to other shapes in the group.  
  Just like before, don't be shy to play with songs you aren't familiar with. And also remember that you don't need to try to memorize the shapes. You'll get to know them just by playing with them.  
  So see what you come up with, and when you feel comfortable naming and playing with each new shape that shows up, that's when you're ready to come back for more.

### Notes

- do I have SVG versions of those old shape animations I could incorporate into the player, so if you touch the shape it shows which notes are in the shape? (or make new ones)
- the direction can also (may better be) the direction of the stroke, starting from the bottom. that's more cohesive than thinking of individual top keys. but also corresponds less clearly with the numbers.
