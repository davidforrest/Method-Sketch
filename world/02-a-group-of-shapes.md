# A Group of Shapes

## Summary

Part 1: Expand to a full group of shapes and continue playing with songs.

Part 2: See the group as a system and add a way to name the shapes.

## The Lesson

**Part A**

Move to the full playlist, play with different shapes. Every shape works the same as the shape you know.

Get to know the new shapes by playing with them. When you start to feel like you've seen each shape that pops up before, go on to Part B.

**Part B**

See the shapes as a system, and name them.

Now, name each new shape when you start to play with it.

This is my favorite lesson, because if you do only this, you could figure everything out on your own.

## Things To Think About

### The keyboard as a diagram
The matter of that same group fitting with lots of songs, then reconfiguring the in/out groups to fit with any (single-group) song. so here we can see, for one, how lots of apps etc work. we can also get the sense that there's something common to all these groups, at least that in each case, seven notes seem to fit and five don't, but we *can't see the pattern with this kind of diagram*. so we can invent a different way to represent this idea.

mapping dots to a shape on the keyboard. here you can still see which notes "fit" and "don't fit," and the group now has a distinctive contour. from there we can look at a system of shapes--to answer the question, "so how many groupings are there?" and this gives us a much different feeling of orientation. we're not in the weeds of the floating dots anymore, but standing back and able to reflect on something much larger.

### The purpose of names
the shape itself can be a symbol for the grouping, and then at a higher level of abstraction, a verbal description of the symbol, which, in theory, you could also use to describe the pre-shape grouping of notes. and these all depend on each other, and assist each other--the names, for example, describe the shape spatially and numerically, which makes it easier to remember, and to describe as a system.

### This is high level music making
it's not just a cool insight, but now you can improvise with any of these songs. it connects you (your intuition) via a symbol (the shape) to the musical world around you. To a community, both now, and in the past. that ought to feel profound.

### Why these groups of notes?

The groups of notes are not derived from the songs (although i'd imagine something like the same groups of notes would result, if not in the same larger organization...) but they are set out with a purpose (they're teleological), which is that they will connect us to a lot of concepts. These notes aren't keys, scales, modes, keys, key signatures, etc., but they have the potential to become those things, or to become other things.

### In-between instruments and names

the instrument diagram is **a symbol, in the shape of an instrument**. but not yet an instrument, and not yet an abstract name. the individual notes don't have names, except for the dots or the keys you'd press to play them, or the regions that represent those keys. the shape names are perhaps a first step in this direction, but they are still descriptions of the shape on the instrument.

### Up and down the ladder of abstraction

and yet, even without a name, these are concrete ideas that you can grab onto and use. you're improvising with any song you hear. that's incredible when you stop to think about it.

getting to this point by building the concepts up from smaller ingredients, would have made it much more difficult. but the process of seeing the larger and smaller pictures is not a linear progression in either direction--it involves a lot of jumping around, a play of larger context and specifics, another form of the opposition of tradition and newness.

### Keep the concepts fluid

i'm pausing to mention this is a marker we can always come back to, to reconnect to something earlier whenever we're making sense of something down the road. it's a kind of source, and we'll find that we can dismantle even this source into smaller ingredients that give us insights into the ways still different approaches developed.  

once again, the goal is to look for the trends, the things that are similar, and to be playful with those things. the most "legit" music concept emerged in this way, and it's also not necessarily so self-aware, or even a distinct concept (take the dorian mode discussion). you get it.

### Some Notes
- the direction can also (may better be) the direction of the stroke, starting from the bottom. that's more cohesive than thinking of individual top keys.
- the experience of playing without boundaries (knowing the structure of the group / names of the shapes) is nice to have for a little while. Not just the experience of playing without names, but of playing without worrying about bounded structure.
- curate by playing. That's different than curating without playing. Need something like a "good to play with" tag. Can I reappropriate "featured" for that and derive what to feature from other fields? I think "featured" was originally "good4shapes" or something like that.
- also that while you're playing, you're not really thinking in terms of whether you like the song or not. You're focused on a different experience.
- the broader value of engaging with things you don't like. or that aren't the things you like. also this populates a field. also it maybe requires some kind of neutral approach to populating the playlist. it's not charged in any direction--it's a representation of what you might come across in the world.
- Some songs are easier to get in to. Why? because they rely less on specific structures? What makes a good intro shapes song?
- after introducing names, name each new shape as you play.
- talk about the natural instrument technique in the shape fingerings lesson meta-level.
