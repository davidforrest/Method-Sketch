# A Group of Shapes


## Lesson Script

[front cam]  
So now I want to take you to a new version of the playlist, and it's linked in the resources for this lesson.

[show the playlist]

In this playlist, when you switch songs, you're going to get some different shapes.

[flip through, land on a 2 or 5 shape, 2R or 5L ideally]

All of these shapes work just like the shape you already played with. Except, of course, they're made up of different notes.

So the notes in *this* shape are  
[outline the shape and play with one finger]

If I choose a different one  
[switch song]

here, the notes are
[outline and play with one finger]

So try a couple of these yourself. Find a song you like that has a new shape, then get the notes down and try playing along with the song.

[try it]

[front cam]
The idea is that you can remember the shape pretty much right away, and then you can think of the *shape* rather than having to remember each individual note one by one.

So go ahead and pause me, and play around with this a little bit. You'll get to know the different shapes just by playing with them, so when each new shape that pops up starts to feel like it's familiar, that's when you're ready to come back for the rest of this lesson.

[pause]


So while you're playing, you start to see some familiar shapes. It's like ok, I've already played with this one, or I've seen that one, and you also start to notice similarities between some of the shapes.

one question that comes up when you're doing this is, how many shapes are there? Are there, like, a hundred different shapes, or is this something I can actually wrap my head around?

So here's an image of a whole group of shapes all at once.

[ultralite diagram]

These are all of the shapes you're going to see in the playlist.

And the way you read this is: if a pair of these groups are right next to each other, like these,
[point to a couple grouping examples]
then they get to be a shape.

But if they're not right next to each other, like these,
[point to a couple examples]
then they don't get to be a shape.

So the first shape we played with was this pair in the middle

[point to the TOP shape]

And shape for the song that's playing right now is here

[point to that shape]

Also you can see that the whole group is symmetrical, so each shape on one side has a shape that's its mirror image on the other side.

[point]

And that symmetry makes it easier to remember, because if you know one shape, you can think of its mirror image and then you know two shapes.

[front cam]
Now, I think it's pretty cool to be able to play with these shapes without necessarily having to name them, or having to name any of the notes that make them up.

Because in a way, the shape itself, it's contour, or a physical key on the keyboard, already gives you a really clear way to represent that sound. What note is it?

[keyboard view]
It's *this* note [point]. What shape is it? Well, it's the shape that goes like this

[draw the stroke on the keyboard with your finger].

But when it comes to a group of shapes, names can actually help you remember the shapes even more easily, and they also make the shapes feel more organized as a system.

Here's how it works. There are the keys that stick up, called the "top" keys, and keys that don't stick up, called the "bottom" keys.

You can name a shape by the number of top keys, and whether they're on the right or left side of the shape.

[point to 1R]

So this pair right here, it has one top key [point], and it's on the right side of the shape, so it's called "1 to the Right."

And then this pair over here, its opposite, would be "1 to the Left."

[point to 2L]

Then this pair over here, it has one, *two* top keys, and they're on the left of the shape, so it's called "2 to the Left."

So there's 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 to the left [point], and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to the right [point]

And then the shape in the middle is called the "TOP" shape [point], centered on the top keys, and the one on either end is the "bottom" shape, because it uses all the bottom keys [point]. And the bottom shape repeats on both ends because the whole group sort of wraps around on itself.

So if I go back to the playlist and look at the shape that's playing, let's see, it has how many top keys?

[count, (3)]

And they're on the (right), so it's "(3 to the right)."

[switch songs, name a few more shapes].

So give this a try yourself. Play along with some different songs, just like you were doing before, but now when a new shape comes up, name it for yourself first. Like, oh this is "2 to the Left," and then play with it.

Pay attention to how each name describes the contour of the shape itself, and it also tells you the shape's position within the larger group. So you start to get a feeling for how the shape are related to one another.

Just like before, don't be afraid to play with songs you don't know. And also keep in mind that you don't need to try to memorize the shapes. You'll get to know them gradually, just by playing with them.

So see what you come up with, and when you feel comfortable naming and playing with each new shape that shows up, that's when you're ready to come back for more.

### Notes

- do I have SVG versions of those old shape animations I could incorporate into the player, so if you touch the shape it shows which notes are in the shape? (or make new ones)
- the direction can also (may better be) the direction of the stroke, starting from the bottom. that's more cohesive than thinking of individual top keys. but also corresponds less clearly with the numbers.
