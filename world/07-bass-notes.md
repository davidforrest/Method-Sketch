# Bass Notes

extend the previous lesson to introduce changing bass notes. they are structured around the anchor, but then they provide the structure for imagined voicings. this is the idea of a chord (not to mention the very beginning of the idea of function, a higher order relationship of bass notes to the song's anchor note). playing any voicings of the shape, along with the changing bass notes, begins to sound distinctively like the song, though not in the usual melodic sense.

## Summary



## The Lesson

This really draws you in to listening in a different way

start by remembering the sequence of bass notes, the way you remembered the shape.

Then work on matching the bass notes to the song.

Then you have two things you can do: Play using the bass notes plus some structures from the last lesson while the song is playing, or turn the song off and play on your own. it will sound like the song, and you have a lot of freedom to play around.


## Things To Think About

this gets you listening more actively into the song, and sets up the next lesson, which is a different kind of listening.

when you listen to music, you can start to listen for this aspect, for the bass notes. It's more structural than the melody, than what most people are used to listening to, focusing on.
