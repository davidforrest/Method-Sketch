# Writing Notes in Time

here will be the place to introduce positional shape notation--a way to capture those structures from imagination-symbols, but only in terms of a succession of events.

then add abstracted time, the idea of a regular pulse. think about how different this is from the actual events taking place in the music, why it belongs squarely in the land of symbols, and what that suggests about symbols more generally.

does notation require a notion of time, and what different approaches to and representations of time are possible? think of a scrolling display versus symbolic rhythmic notation.

## Summary



## The Lesson

This builds on / draws on the listening from the last two lessons.

Start by notating bass notes, dots as events. You still have to remember them to match them with the song, but now you're getting them from the page rather than by watching them played on the keyboard.

Notes as "x notes above or below the anchor"

How to notate the groupings / patterns of bass notes? different lines? You're relying on your ear here.

Then add pulse

passive: some more bass note patterns notated

active: maybe notate some of the things from Lesson 5 (playing with the anchor)

Songs

  good for chords
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPpTgCho5ZA
  bass notes land on some pretty unusual anchors. how do those translate to chords? shape might change in the bridge.
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYq4mlNiDTg
  single shape, key level anchor, alternates 2 chords
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btrzs54s1Rc
  single shape, different chord change timings.

10/12-13/2021 notes

- we haven't been paying attention to octave. 6 above versus 3 below. the range. just it's the note and i can play it wherever on the piano.
- so that's something to add in the notation lesson.
- you don't have octave range exactly--but you do have some relationship... you're telling if it's higher or lower than the anchor.
- strictly use "relative to the anchor" terminology. no "2 notes below the last note"
- "the number 3 note of the shape" if the anchor is one.
- "the third note of the shape, starting from the anchor"
- the 7th below the anchor
- which is one note below.
- you'd use the notation to tell if it's above or below the shape, but either way, it's the "sixth" note of the shape, starting from the anchor.
- let's start using it and see how it feels.
- so, introduce degrees in notation.
- so it's those three notes, "anchor, third, fourth"
- i was able to use a verbal name. and not point at the keyboard. that's cool.
- writing the note once rather than twice-- a change rather than a repeated event.
- two options-- if you notate the bass note, you have two anchors. but if you notate the points where it changes, you have only one.
- it's asking you to hear something pretty abstract in the song.
- it's not how you might naturally listen.
really the lowest beat level, trying to single that out.
- a kind of structural listening.
- confusing bass notes with the idea of beat, in a way you don't necessarily with melody.
- starting with a layer that's fundamental enough, you're building a layer of resemblance. and that's not unlike the idea of shapes or groupings that sound good.
- resembling isn't mimicking-- you're not playing the song--it's different. a different kind of relationship to the song.
- make a notation and play along with the song a little to hear how it fits.

- [11:58 AM, 10/13/2021] David: i was wrong about the note naming actually--there's a reason not to introduce something like degrees at this point. The way we should name notes is "one higher than the anchor, one lower than the anchor," etc.
- [11:59 AM, 10/13/2021] David: or "above" / "below" the anchor
- [11:59 AM, 10/13/2021] David: So the bieber bass line is the anchor, then 2 above the anchor, then 3 above the anchor.
- [12:00 PM, 10/13/2021] David: names in music are a real problem.
- [12:00 PM, 10/13/2021] David: i don't think bieber is worried about it, though.
