# Writing Notes in Time

here will be the place to introduce positional shape notation--a way to capture those structures from imagination-symbols, but only in terms of a succession of events.

then add abstracted time, the idea of a regular pulse. think about how different this is from the actual events taking place in the music, why it belongs squarely in the land of symbols, and what that suggests about symbols more generally.

does notation require a notion of time, and what different approaches to and representations of time are possible? think of a scrolling display versus symbolic rhythmic notation.

## Summary



## The Lesson

This builds on / draws on the listening from the last two lessons.

Start by notating bass notes, dots as events. You still have to remember them to match them with the song, but now you're getting them from the page rather than by watching them played on the keyboard.

Notes as "x notes above or below the anchor"

How to notate the groupings / patterns of bass notes? different lines? You're relying on your ear here.

Then add pulse

passive: some more bass note patterns notated

active: maybe notate some of the things from Lesson 5 (playing with the anchor)
