# A Shape

## Summary

Use a shape to play along with a playlist of songs. Hear when notes fit and don't fit. Start to follow your musical instincts.

## The Lesson

Here's a current playlist, a snapshot of the world.

And here's how to read a shape.

## Things To Think About

### Songs as the world
A hyper-real snapshot of the present moment, perhaps with one foot in the future.

### Notes that Fit  
The notion of a group of notes fitting with a song, and the "fit" as a kind of tacit knowledge to leverage.


### One of infinite aspects
Interesting to think what it means to draw out this particular aspect of a tacit relationship with the world, and to be able to play around with it. this both separates us from the world, and brings us closer. it's a sort of scientific discovery, a potential to modify the world, or to inquire into it...

### Is this real music?
preempt questions like "where are the note names?" or "aren't you just drawing scales on the piano..." etc.
