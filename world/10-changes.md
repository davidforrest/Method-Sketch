# Changes

introduce changing shapes and anchors (as distinct from, but indicated by changing note events), and how changes like these are more general (abstract?), and yet sometimes more accessible, than note-level changes. illustrated by the matter of exactly when they change--on the pulse or the event?

and what about changes in the events themselves, for example, on a second listening once the context has changed. that's heavy. but the practical take-away is really something like beginning a foundation for ideas like harmonic rhythm, and song structure, and chords changes... spotting when things change, points of articulation, with notation as the "instrument" to do that.

could we apply these same questions back to the note level? for example, that the note symbol is an abstraction of the sound, it's "onset," etc.
