# Moods

introduce two add'l moods and name them: "neutral, single light, single heavy" (this and the numbers are transposable, relative symbol systems).

show that you retain your feeling of tonescape tensions in these different moods

With the new moods, introduce the light/heavy way of naming tensions. It relates to the progression of moods.

begin using "light/heavy third" and "light/heavy sixth" to distinguish the tensions that change for each mood.

also hear these different moods in some example songs, and name note events in a song as tensions in a mood. all this is about things that generalize: the tonal version of the abstraction set up by time in the last pass through Symbols.
