# A Group of Shapes

## Summary



## The Lesson

**Part A**

Move to the full playlist, play with different shapes. Every shape works the same as the shape you know.

Get to know the new shapes by playing with them. When you start to feel like you've seen each shape that pops up before, go on to Part B.

**Part B**

See the shapes as a system, and name them.
