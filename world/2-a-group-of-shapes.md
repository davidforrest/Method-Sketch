# A Group of Shapes

## Summary

Part 1: Expand to a full group of shapes and continue playing with songs.

Part 2: See the group as a system and add a way to name the shapes.

## The Lesson

**Part A**

Move to the full playlist, play with different shapes. Every shape works the same as the shape you know.

Get to know the new shapes by playing with them. When you start to feel like you've seen each shape that pops up before, go on to Part B.

**Part B**

See the shapes as a system, and name them.

Now, name each new shape when you start to play with it.


## Things To Think About

### The keyboard as a diagram
The matter of that same group fitting with lots of songs, then reconfiguring the in/out groups to fit with any (single-group) song. so here we can see, for one, how lots of apps etc work. we can also get the sense that there's something common to all these groups, at least that in each case, seven notes seem to fit and five don't, but we *can't see the pattern with this kind of diagram*. so we can invent a different way to represent this idea.

mapping dots to a shape on the keyboard. here you can still see which notes "fit" and "don't fit," and the group now has a distinctive contour. from there we can look at a system of shapes--to answer the question, "so how many groupings are there?" and this gives us a much different feeling of orientation. we're not in the weeds of the floating dots anymore, but standing back and able to reflect on something much larger.

### The purpose of names
the shape itself can be a symbol for the grouping, and then at a higher level of abstraction, a verbal description of the symbol, which, in theory, you could also use to describe the pre-shape grouping of notes. and these all depend on each other, and assist each other--the names, for example, describe the shape spatially and numerically, which makes it easier to remember, and to describe as a system.

### This is high level music making
it's not just a cool insight, but now you can improvise with any of these songs. it connects you (your intuition) via a symbol (the shape) to the musical world around you. To a community, both now, and in the past. that ought to feel profound.
