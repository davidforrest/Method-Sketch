# Shape Fingerings

## Summary

How hands match the keyboard, and how to play hands together in any shape, beginning on any note, using only one fingering pattern.

This helps develop a natural technique and a tactile reference for playing without looking at the keyboard.

## The Lesson

[start with a demo of what we're gonna do and a little bit of why. think about what of the explanation below is meta-level stuff].

This is too rote:

  There's a relationship between our bodies, and the design of our instruments.

  Look at your hands, they are mirror images of one another.

  from a certain perspective, one side of the keyboard is also a mirror image of the other.

  Our pointer, middle, and ring fingers stick up above our thumbs and pinkies. The keyboard also has keys that stick up above the others.

  What's more, the keyboard is a repeating pattern of hand-shaped groups of keys.

  By placing our fingers that stick up on the keys that stick up, we can feel how closely the contour of the keyboard matches the contour of our hands.

  This is the starting point for Shape Fingerings. Shape Fingerings are a guideline to help develop a natural finger technique and a tactile reference for playing without looking at the keyboard.

  The central rule of Shape Fingerings is to align our fingers that stick up (pointer, middle, and ring fingers) with the keys that stick up (groups of 2 and 3 top keys), and then to move our fingers into each shape beginning from this position.

Steps:

1. just the top keys, all at once, then up and down the kybd. try to feel for it without looking. grab the groups, and your fingers are where they're supposed to be. try to get to where you're playing with the beat, or making up a beat. use the beat as an incentive to hit the notes in time. in fact, get to where you're playing with the beat without looking before moving on. that's a concrete challenge.
2. add in thumbs. make it really distinct: "thumbs, 1, 2, 3, thumbs, 1, 2"
3. move into the 5s, etc.

Start each session with playing, then move into working on the fingerings, and end with playing. This starts to introduce some more technique-like stuff than the previous two lessons, so bookend it with playing. You'll probably notice some of the technique stuff working its way into your playing. I also like how this inverts the usual "warm up, then play" routine of practicing scales.

thinking about these as scales, going all the way up and down, versus as being more local, practicing the fingering, picking up the beat, allowing fingering changes, mistakes, letting it become a guide. less as an exercise, but as a way of feeling more comfortable with the keyboard. that should be the "when am i done" goal.

At first, the feeling that it has to be right, to the feeling that it's not about rightness at all.

then back to [a_group] plist to add the rest.

in the future, if you keep doing this:
try playing contrary, opposite directions.
then try playing contrary starting on different (unmatched) fingers.
to transition from up/down to contrary, you can make the transition with the same fingerings if it's on a symmetrical note (Pe, Re). But if from any other note, the fingerings diverge, which is a good challenge.



## Things To Think About

- Reversible keyboard polarity
- Future: absolute tactile sense, etc.
- Meta: the design of instruments also reflect the design of musical concepts and theoretical systems.

notes:
- maybe demo what you're going to be able to do first. then it's more tolerable to go through the rote steps, or to listen to stuff about hands fitting keys, etc.
- you'll still get auditory feedback if you play a note that's outside the shape
- reiterate that it's the same fingering for each new shape you add. start with the fingering for the previous shape you know, and then adjust one finger for the next shape. That's a different way to think of it than "start with the basic fingering and move into the shape." Both are good, but different.
