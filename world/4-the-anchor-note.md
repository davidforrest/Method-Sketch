# The Anchor Note

## Summary



## The Lesson

Roughly the 13.1.27 script

Except mention that the anchor can (and will) be any note of the shape. So it's not like "the anchor for this shape," but more like the anchor for a particular song. Different anchors in the same shape.

The goal is to become familiar with this sound of pulling toward the anchor note.
