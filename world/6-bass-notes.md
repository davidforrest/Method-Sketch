# Bass Notes

## Summary



## The Lesson

This really draws you in to listening in a different way

start by remembering the sequence of bass notes, the way you remembered the shape.

Then work on matching the bass notes to the song.

Then you have two things you can do: Play using the structures from the last lesson while the song is playing, or turn the song off and play on your own. it will sound like the song, and you have a lot of freedom to play around.


## Things To Think About

this gets you listening more actively into the song, and sets up the next lesson, which is a different kind of listening.

when you listen to music, you can start to listen for this aspect, for the bass notes.
