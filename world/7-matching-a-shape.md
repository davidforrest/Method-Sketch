# Matching A Shape

## Summary



## The Lesson

- Start with the ultralite diagram top row matching approach
  - play the notes with the beat of the song to hear them more easily.
- if one note fits, other shapes are adjacent
- then try the note-by-note approach

then you start to develop intuition -- to hear in advance if a note is going to fit.

if 2 notes sound bad, the note in between them will sound good. process of elimination.

You can't always tell what's right, but you can really hear what's wrong (when a note doesn't fit). The negative feedback is very helpful here.

If you miss one, listen and compare it. correct it. That's an opportunity for self-learning.

the group layout is a scaffolding. let it drop away however it drops away. when you stop needing it, let yourself stop needing it

tip: try in a different register. and go back and forth between two notes if you're unsure which one is correct (that's like going back and forth between two shapes/strokes). the point is to make up concrete techniques for yourself to try.



## Things To Think About

"Woman Oh Mama" can be 5L (minor) or TOP (dorian). That kind of situation.

- This lesson makes what you've been doing active.
- also it's the point where you can turn on the radio and play with whatever you hear. a confidence boost, oh, i really am hearing things!
