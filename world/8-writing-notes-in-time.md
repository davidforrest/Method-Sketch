# Writing Notes in Time

## Summary



## The Lesson

This builds on / draws on the listening from the last two lessons.

Start by notating bass notes, dots as events. You still have to remember them to match them with the song, but now you're getting them from the page rather than by watching them played on the keyboard.

Notes as "x notes above or below the anchor"

How to notate the groupings / patterns of bass notes? different lines? You're relying on your ear here.

Then add pulse

passive: some more bass note patterns notated

active: maybe notate some of the things from Lesson 5 (playing with the anchor)
