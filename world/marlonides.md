### The Marlonides

PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE: Marlonides, Elaian, David, Iordanes.

---

*Marlonides discovers a video on YouTube, called [Songs that use the Dorian mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Zzztd5ZCk), and shares it on Slack.*

**Marlonides**: If you are like me and love the Doors (i.e. probably no one here :) . . . then this is a GREAT touchstone for remembering the feel of the Dorian mode . . . and the comparison with the sound of the natural minor is really instructive I think (0:45-1:25)

**Elaian**: come on Marlonides, i friggin' LOVE the Doors (and the Dorian mode...). thanks for posting, this is awesome.

**David**: Maybe I should bite my tongue here, but this video raises a lot of questions, right from the very first sentence, "The Dorian mode, or the Dorian scale, is basically just a special type of minor scale."

And compounding that, "B Dorian is derived from A Major..."

Not to mention, "The minor i chord acts to set us in a minor key, and the Major IV chord introduces the signature raised 6th note," or calling a i-7 a "minor" chord, while playing a i-9...

These all seem to suggest a very particular--although standard--way to approach modes and chords, and perhaps we shouldn't take that for granted, Because there may be other potentially useful ideas on the sidelines, or secretly baked in, or that are not yet ideas.

If I may ask, is minor a mode like dorian, or some functional description at a higher level of abstraction, or both, such that the functional thing gets infused into the modal thing with the same name?

Same for Major. A mode at the level of “this sounds major,” or a description of a larger structure in the music (or in other music generally that’s not this music specifically).  

Does the chord symbol represent the specific notes of the chord, or a specific realization of a collection of notes, or the collection of notes itself, or all of these things?

Does the idea of mode exist intrinsically within each individual chord symbol, or is it something that generalizes across multiple changing chords?

If the “sound” of the song or passage is Dorian, and there is a minor triad, is that then a “Dorian” triad?

Or does minor describe only the specific arrangement of notes, the triad itself, irrespective of its context.  

Or does “minor” reach right through the “Dorian” context and appeal to a larger, functional context that we don’t readily hear?

And if so, why is that context called minor, and not also Dorian?

If the song sounds Dorian, then why isn’t natural minor “Dorian with a lowered sixth note” in that context?

Or Major “Dorian with a raised third and seventh note”

The people want to know.

**Marlonides**: hmmmmm . . . I want to learn more about all the things you are saying, but to summarize my response this this particular video, it's more that the riders on the storm opening has SUCH a specific vibe, one that's so drilled in to my head, that it's now the easiest way for me to call to mind this collection of notes

And the aeolian vs dorian demo really made sense intuitively . . . it made me think "I really hear that, it's like Dorian is the Lydian of the minor world"

Mainly I'm trying to get better at hearing differences and naming them, not so much so that I get the right words out, but so that when improvising I more quickly hear whether I should be raising or lowering the 6th (which I don't really call the 6th, more the choice between playing a third note on the A string or just two and adding one on the D string as you go up) . . . my sense is that I only "get it wrong" from the David perspective when I try to take this detour through language on the way to finding the right note :)

But I do think that words sometimes help you notice things . . . even the wrong words

I have missed having you around to debate these things!

**David**: That makes sense Marlonides. the point is to internalize the feeling of that difference, so you can do things with it, so it can become a part of you. but then, the words create the model that allows the comparison. the “minor world” does not necessarily apply to this music, and it would be different to, say, delineate a minor world that’s distinct from the specific minor mode, to create a palette of successive shades of “minor,” of which the minor mode is one, and to compare two adjacent modes, both by looking at the note-by-note differences, and by listening to songs that use those modes. my objection is that the concepts are messy in a way that introduces as much confusion as clarification, even if that confusion is kicked a little ways down the road.

It’s also interesting to think of dorian as the lydian of minor. especially because they’re admitting of extended chord structures in a way that strict minor and major are not

An extended major chord defaults to lydian, and an extended minor chord defaults to dorian

But that’s also still appealing to the major-minor model and chords-as-triads, because, for one, other modes (like Mixolydian, or “Dominant”) are just as admitting. It’s an opportunity for some theorizing: Is this because these are the farthest extremes of the major and minor palette? Or is it even true at all--a purely minor or major song is plenty well capable of containing extended harmonies that don’t match up with its chord symbols.

All to say, the words that function at the same level as the things we’re trying to hear are very helpful.

But when they function at a different level, and get conflated with the level we’re listening for, things get unnecessarily confusing.

Also what you said about the detour through language is interesting. i think you’re one step closer to dealing with what really matters when you take a fret, or position on your instrument, as your symbol, rather than any sort of name. but there are still models that influence how you see (and think and hear) these nameless elements of your musical experience, and those models are designed and designable. the danger would be to say all this is just a theoretical argument. maybe having the conversation at that lower level of abstraction is a way to help avoid that danger.

Otherwise theorists should not meddle in the affairs of musicians

**Marlonides**: :)

I am way slower than you in this territory, but I do like the way shapes work as conceptual schema

Like on guitar as you find scales you have these 4 fret chunks (like in the minor pentatonic scale everyone learns when starting out), and when you play three of those 4 you have a whole-step/half-step chunk

And you have one of these per string all the way up

So those are the fragments that you think in terms of

**David**: these are diagrams in the shape of an instrument

**Marlonides**: But you can easily get confused about whether this string works with frets 5-6-8 or 5-7-8  

And I have to admit that learning a bit more about the modes (even through YouTube) has given me a better grasp of what's happening when I make a mistake, etc.

**David**: Because you can hear it?

**Marlonides**: It's more that it gives me a word to explain what seemed confusing and disorienting before

But yes

The disorientation comes from hearing

like you start with the minor pentatonic if you are someone who likes Jimi H and Jimmy P

then you add some additional notes, but are disoriented about those extra notes

because some work in certain songs but not in others

**David**: So the idea of the mode becomes a device to organize the particulars and make them more manageable

and the form it takes is a physical form on your instrument

which you verify by what you hear

**Marlonides**: I think your ears and the shape it takes on your instrument are the keys

**David**: I have to agree

**Marlonides**: But I love learning the math and geometry behind it all

It may or may not help :)

**David**: but don’t forget that your ears and the shape it takes on your instrument are still involved with the abstract model

**Marlonides**: but my band in 1994 topped out with 4-chord changes of the 1-4-5-6 variety

**David**: the idea of the mode

**Marlonides**: and I may have avoided all this academic stuff if I had met you then :)

though you would have been younger I guess

**David**: was I younger in 1994?

**Marlonides**: well . . .

*I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now...*

**David**: actually, in 1994 i had just discovered, of all things, these two chords that were in that video a lot

minor 9 to dominant 13

which is moving only one note

and improvising in the dorian mode

in 1994 the dorian mode is the only thing i would have been able to talk to you about.

**Marlonides**: :)

maybe I would have done better with child-David, being more on his musico-intellectual level :)

**David**: but thinking of different ways to scaffold the fretboard-as-a-diagram is very interesting

it’s a different problem than a keyboard

but the models still need to generalize

and also to generalize to notation, which is another form of instrument

and then to the words, which are perhaps descriptions of the notational diagrams

**Marlonides**: the fretboard is great because you have these shapes you just slide up and down to retain the relationships . . . that's why piano always confused me, because the white key/black key opposition introduces this difference that seems to matter, but doesn't matter on guitar

**David**: (and somewhere in between is the Push, and Traktor, etc…)

**Marlonides**: there are no 'black notes' on stringed instruments

**David**: and yet, one thing lost is the distinctive terrain of each key

**David**: in favor of a position

**Marlonides**: this is really a thing . . . because the "TRUE" shapes aren't "white white black" or "three to the left" (you've been gone too long, I've forgotten them!)

they are just shapes

**David**: also the strings are staggered in different ways, depending on the tuning

**Marlonides**: and they move around

without sharps and flats ever entering the picture

so when I first learned that the modes happen on all white keys with different root notes I found this TOTALLY weird as a way of thinking about it, but also highly pleasing as an intellectual puzzle

**Iordanes**: i find a similar puzzle with the "lighter" modes "holding" more "whole steps" in "heavier" combinations, more towards the "beginning" of the "scale" from the "root" "note"...

**Marlonides**: but on a stringed instrument it's more about knowing whether that string fragment has the whole step in this spot rather than that spot . . . then just sliding this up and down

**Iordanes**: its true

when you look at the patterns from "lydian" to "locrian"

and the W-H-...combinations i find wayyyy more useful than memorizing note combinations within the "key" of "c"...

**David**: so “TRUE” here begs some questions

because on one hand, if you separate a Shape from its absolute position, it loses something important

and yet if you’re free of that, you can see a different aspect

which in a way is more general, because it can move around

**Marlonides**: well . . . you already know that I think that the grid controller represents THE truth :)

**David**: but is the ability to transpose exactly an abstraction from absoluteness?

this makes more sense. the grid is the purest form of the guitar

**Marlonides**: you don't even need to use the word "transpose" as if it's a "thing" in the word of guitar and grid controllers

**David**: it is the TRUE form that the guitar fretboard is striving for

**Marlonides**: like for someone who sucks at piano (me) you are screwed if someone wants you to move from C-G-Am-F to something up or down 3 steps

on the grid controller, you don't even need a word for this, it's too simple

**David**: too simple!

“so let me ask you…”

do you not have hands, with fingers? and is C-G-Am-F the same thing as its transposition up or down 3 steps?

in the abstraction of “Major chord” from “C Major chord,” what gets left behind?  

or is something gained?

do we want those shapes to be the same?

**Marlonides**: wait--aren't they the same--I'm confused. On guitar, a power chord or bar chord is ONE shape you learn, and you move it up and down, and you know that the bar chord based on E up and down the fretboard also marks where the minor pentatonic scale for blues in that key lands . . . on piano, every triad changes in stressful ways as you move up and down

**David**: they’re the same in their relationship, and the relationship of their parts, yes

**Marlonides**: so there is just "major chord" based on E and "major chord" based on A that you slide up and down, then also the minors of each . . . getting your muscles into those shapes is the hard part, but then going up and down the neck is trivial

whereas on piano there's this intellectual component of knowing how the major triad is going to land across white keys and black keys

it sounds like I'm attacking piano, which is absurd . . . just trying to think from within a "pro-grid-controller" position to think this through with you (and guitar is the instrument closest to the grid controller)

**David**: could there be something necessary, even beautiful in the different shape of an E Major and F# Major chord on the piano, where they’re only “the same” through an abstraction--an abstraction that you begin to see when you look toward the backs of the keys?

and that’s fully realized in the grid controller?

**Marlonides**: :)

F# major is sooo triggering

**David**: there seems to be a real distinction in saying “it’s all the same thing, now move it around,” versus “each thing is different, but you can derive qualities of sameness”

but if we dip back below the name and name it by the keys you press…

**Marlonides**: yes---but if the differences produce complexity (like the sharps of pieces in F# major) that isn't strictly speaking necessary, that can't be a good thing  

**David**: aha, and is that not because F# Major is named in relation to C Major?

or at least to “no sharps, no flats”

**Marlonides**: I feel like F# major is a metaphor for certain aspects of higher ed...

**David**: a distinction that disappears in this realm of instrument-as-diagram

**Marlonides**: yeah--but once you go with black keys and white keys there's going to be an odd-man-out or odd-key-out

**David**: does anything change if we call them “top” keys and “bottom” keys?

**Marlonides**: still an opposition

**David**: that correspond to fingers that stick up, and fingers that don’t stick up?

**Marlonides**: when is there REALLY a binary opposition governing this system?

**David**: don’t we have three fingers in the middle of our hands that stick up above the others?

  **Iordanes**: i dunno bout this one

  staring at my hand...

  i also have one finger that sticks up more than all the others

  and then theres the four that stick in one sort of direction

  and then that weird one that moves all around...

  i feel like mayyyyybe the 3 fingers up thing miiiight be pianisticentric?

  for a guitar player, the one that moves all around could steady, or frame, or bar depending on the player

  and the grip of a hand could be more fitting to the neck of a stringed intrument

  although i personally hate that feeling

  **David**: Maybe it makes more sense to focus on the “contour” of the hand?

  which of a push, guitar fretboard, or piano looks most like a human hand?

  maybe they all do, look like different aspects of a human hand.

**Marlonides**: trippy man

I guess it's the whole step, half step opposition that governs it

but that really feels like an abstraction, a derivative

**David**: and even that is a technology of equal temperament

the whole-step half-step opposition

yes, it’s really interesting to call that an abstraction

rather than something elemental

a result rather than a cause

**Marlonides**: ugh--this is also trippy, and the point my head explodes . . . .

**David**: the TRUE realization of a originary binary opposition of whole and half steps would be

the GRID

**Marlonides**: (realizing that the whole 12-note thing is an approximation)

a grid that constantly reworks itself to get closer to just intonation than equal temperament

**David**: right, and that’s why there’s something important in retaining the individuality of each of the shapes

they get to be distinct and general

absolute and relative

the keyboard actually bakes the absolute history into the design, the layout of the instrument, in a way that the fretboard, or at least the grid, does not.

it's not the hands, fingers sticking up and down, but the existence of bottom keys, period, that show where this started.

to move from this chord progression to the same thing up or down, actually, that would be simple in shapes if you were to shift the shape in a way that's not in terms of thinking of the structures. which is interesting. the shape and the moving anchors.

**Marlonides**: when I learning that the 12th root of 2 wasn't really the thing, that everything I ever listen to HAS to be a little off, I really almost couldn't handle it . . . it felt like the world was broken and unfixable in a completely novel way

  **Iordanes**: when I realized this, it felt GREAT! I was like, whhhaaaatt? I'm not alone out here feeling like everything is just a little bit made up and nothing actually fits perfectly? liberated! ecstatic!

  all of the sudden, the sounds of music and how i interacted with them became way more like art

  and way less like math

  i was like, get outta here math!

  i just floated in a cloud of gridless freedom

  well, not quite gridless (edited)

  but the grid was a malleable form I could exist in contentedly

**David**: tactile and not unconsciously transposable

“broken and unfixable in a completely novel way”

isn’t that (or perhaps a slightly less negative-sounding version of that) the highest goal of education?

that we constantly see our familiar world in that way?

**Marlonides**: :)

I think as a backwoods Canadian boy you assume that the grown-ups, the experts back East in Toronto or New York or London and Paris must know it all, and whatever they make (pianos, musical scores, operas, theories of music) must be right . . . and that any imperfections in the system are produced by fallible provincial people, west-coasters, small-towners, garage-banders. So when you learn that the thing is a priori broken, well . . . it's like when the Oracle tells Neo he isn't the One  

**David**: or to reframe a priori broken

to a priori opposition

opposition, held in place, that becomes generative

Btw, didn’t the oracle have to tell Neo he wasn’t the One?

so that he could become the One?

generative oppositions.

so are the experts saying “this is the truth”

because they believe it’s the truth? or in order to enable you to find the truth

“here I will delineate the bounds of this idea of Dorian…”

“so that you can decompose, and potentially recompose this concept…”

“and bring it closer to the TRUTH.”

(and btw you are not the One)

**Marlonides**: :)

**David**: there have been many Ones before you, and they all failed.

so what will you do?

will you choose the Push?

or the piano?

or, will we construct a new matrix of musical models within our own minds that we then use to imprison or liberate the technological world...?

**Marlonides**: when the rules align with the truth, the prison IS liberation

**Iordanes**: This conversation makes me nostalgic for the old days.

Then review https://workflowy.com/#/0f18bcea81a7

  the point here is to avoid explaining anything. except, perhaps, explaining an ingredient that's composed, in order to compose it, and to allow it to be recomposed. the subtext otherwise is that "this is the way it is." it closes it down rather than opens it up. it makes the idea have power over you, rather than vice versa.
