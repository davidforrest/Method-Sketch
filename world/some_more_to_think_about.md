## Some More to Think About


### How do I know I'm doing it right? (Lesson 1)
Yes.

### Is the shape a scale? (Lesson 1)

The way to think of a shape is an idea that underlies all the things, scale, chord, etc-- it's a little more zoomed out. So from a shape, you could derive a scale, you could derive chords, you could derive modes, key signatures, the structure of the notation system... but something common to all those things is this pool of notes that sounds like it fits together. So if you decide to play them in order, you have a scale or a mode. But if you decide to play them as a random cluster, you get a fat-sounding chord. Or you could do something else. The healthiest way to think of a shape is not-yet-a-scale, not-yet-a-mode... but with the potential to become any of those things.

- nora's first question: "how does this relate to chords?" which was really to say "why does this work?" my answer was, first that this method is my way of answering that question. because otherwise you have to define the terms. but the notes of a shape are a collection of notes that you can use to describe the physics stuff, or keys, or chords, or any number of other concepts, like a lowest common denominator. Also that the collection of notes in the key and chord levels overlap in these songs--it's a curated playlist, although it's also the norm. So it doesn't work because of chords, scales, keys, etc., but it is common to all those things, and so it's a way to derive those things, and also to get at other things.

if you don't know any theory, you can think of the shape as a theory concept. it's an idea that you can play within.

### Is this real music? (Lesson 1)

preempt questions like "where are the note names?" or "aren't you just drawing scales on the piano..." etc.

### Why these groups of notes? (Lesson 2)

The groups of notes are not derived from the songs (although i'd imagine something like the same groups of notes would result, if not in the same larger organization...) but they are set out with a purpose (they're teleological), which is that they will connect us to a lot of concepts. These notes aren't keys, scales, modes, keys, key signatures, etc., but they have the potential to become those things, or to become other things.

### Songs as the world (Lesson 1)

A hyper-real snapshot of the present moment, perhaps with one foot in the future.

- and the style/genre thing. most of the time you're not getting to play this style of music.

---

### Choosing an instrument sound to play with (Lesson 1)

This matters. The notes fit, but the instrument also has to fit so that you can pay attention to the notes, which are ind of subtler. If the sound isn't right, or if it's too loud, or too high or low, it won't sound like it fits. So that's a consideration first, and the player has those instrument settings done in advance. So if you're playing on your own instrument, a synth or something like that,

---

### Notes that Fit (Lesson 1)

The notion of a group of notes fitting with a song, and the "fit" as a kind of tacit knowledge to leverage.

### One of infinite aspects (Lesson 1)

Interesting to think what it means to draw out this particular aspect of a tacit relationship with the world, and to be able to play around with it. this both separates us from the world, and brings us closer. it's a sort of scientific discovery, a potential to modify the world, or to inquire into it...

- my theory goal was, i think, to show that we have knowledge in music already, in all kinds of domains, and that we're accessing and formalizing that knowledge with a tool, the shape. We could do this with infinite domains. But the purpose of choosing this particular domain is the way it lines up with all the concepts in the tradition we trust--the things we think we want to learn. chords, keys, notation, etc.

---

### Lighting up the notes to play

This doesn't tell you which notes to play, but more tells you the collection of notes you can draw from. And that's a pretty significant difference. You have the options and then follow your intuition.

---

### Playing without names (Lesson 2)

the experience of playing without boundaries (knowing the structure of the group / names of the shapes) is nice to have for a little while. Not just the experience of playing without names, but of playing without worrying about bounded structure.

---

### The keyboard as a diagram (Lesson 2)

The matter of that same group fitting with lots of songs, then reconfiguring the in/out groups to fit with any (single-group) song. so here we can see, for one, how lots of apps etc work. we can also get the sense that there's something common to all these groups, at least that in each case, seven notes seem to fit and five don't, but we *can't see the pattern with this kind of diagram*. so we can invent a different way to represent this idea.

mapping dots to a shape on the keyboard. here you can still see which notes "fit" and "don't fit," and the group now has a distinctive contour. from there we can look at a system of shapes--to answer the question, "so how many groupings are there?" and this gives us a much different feeling of orientation. we're not in the weeds of the floating dots anymore, but standing back and able to reflect on something much larger.

Also, this isn't a keyboard method or something like that. Sure, you're playing on a keyboard, but the keyboard is a tool that's representing these groups of notes in a really easy-to-remember mnemonic. That's not as easy on any other instrument layout. Like chord shapes on a guitar. The groups of notes will relate to any instrument, and the keyboard is an easy way to get there, a scaffolding.

---

### The purpose of names (Lesson 2)

the shape itself can be a symbol for the grouping, and then at a higher level of abstraction, a verbal description of the symbol, which, in theory, you could also use to describe the pre-shape grouping of notes. and these all depend on each other, and assist each other--the names, for example, describe the shape spatially and numerically, which makes it easier to remember, and to describe as a system.

---

### This is high level music making (Lesson 2)

it's not just a cool insight, but now you can improvise with any of these songs. it connects you (your intuition) via a symbol (the shape) to the musical world around you. To a community, both now, and in the past. that ought to feel profound.

---

### In-between instruments and names (Lesson 2)

the instrument diagram is **a symbol, in the shape of an instrument**. but not yet an instrument, and not yet an abstract name. the individual notes don't have names, except for the dots or the keys you'd press to play them, or the regions that represent those keys. the shape names are perhaps a first step in this direction, but they are still descriptions of the shape on the instrument.

---

### Up and down the ladder of abstraction (Lesson 2)

and yet, even without a name, these are concrete ideas that you can grab onto and use. you're improvising with any song you hear. that's incredible when you stop to think about it.

getting to this point by building the concepts up from smaller ingredients, would have made it much more difficult. but the process of seeing the larger and smaller pictures is not a linear progression in either direction--it involves a lot of jumping around, a play of larger context and specifics, another form of the opposition of tradition and newness.

---

### Keep the concepts fluid (Lesson 2)

i'm pausing to mention this is a marker we can always come back to, to reconnect to something earlier whenever we're making sense of something down the road. it's a kind of source, and we'll find that we can dismantle even this source into smaller ingredients that give us insights into the ways still different approaches developed.  

once again, the goal is to look for the trends, the things that are similar, and to be playful with those things. the most "legit" music concept emerged in this way, and it's also not necessarily so self-aware, or even a distinct concept (take the dorian mode discussion). you get it.

---

### What makes a song good for shapes? (Lesson 2)

Some songs are easier to get in to. Why? because they rely less on specific structures? What makes a good intro shapes song?

---

### Memorizing vs. getting to know

Truth is, if you never use a shape, you probably don't need to remember it. Then it's just taking up space in your brain.

---

### Permission

Lesson 2 is actually my favorite lesson, because if this was the only thing you ever learned about music, and you really ran with it, you'd actually have the tools to figure just about everything else out on your own...

---

### What are fingerings meant to accomplish? (Lesson 3)

talk about the natural instrument technique in the shape fingerings lesson meta-level.

---

### Where is the stuff I play coming from?

You kind of remember how something's used in songs you've heard your whole life, and how other musicians have used it, and then you respond to that.
