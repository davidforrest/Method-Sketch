### Thinking Music Theory Anew

<br>

Most of us who are interested in music have a sense that we ought to know something about *music theory*. But what exactly does that mean? Probably that we should be able to name notes, to know our scales and key signatures, to identify chords and chord progressions, to understand song structure, arrangement, and melodic structure, and ideally, to be able to read music.

All these ideas are handed to us as the elements, the basics, the building blocks of music. They're tools we can use, and they explain how and why music works the way it does.

But hold on a moment. Let's rewind and take a closer look at these building blocks. And let's try to pick the simplest one possible--the first note name most people learn--the note "C".

Leaving aside the question of why the first note most people learn isn't called "A", there's the much stranger matter that "C" isn't necessarily a note name at all. "C" means something more than just which note you're playing, because if its only job were to describe that one note, we wouldn't have situations where the very same note is called, for example, "B sharp" or "D double flat." The name "C", then, might describe something more like a position within a larger context--it suggests more than just that one note. Beyond that, this system of naming notes offers absolutely no way to name a note *without* adding this extra layer of meaning.

This implies something extraordinary, and we might not have even noticed--that it's possible to open up even that simplest idea, "C", into its own set of elements, with the potential to recompose it into different ideas, to use in different ways, for different purposes, and to describe different experiences. The blueprint for a whole musical system is contained right there in that supposedly smallest building block, and when you start thinking this way, you're no longer learning the ideas that are handed down to you, but you're stepping inside and participating in thinking those ideas anew, in bringing them to life, in allowing them to evolve.

Here, we're maybe getting closer to what *music theory* might mean.


#### Noticing hidden theories

then you might talk about how very quickly this principle goes beyond theoretical concepts. the way a controller or the UI of a virtual instrument, or especially a DAW is laid out, is telling us something about the musical system its participating in. think about the ableton push. and it goes deeper than this, the code that underlies those technologies, is quite literally a theory of music. the way music is encoded in MIDI, the function that generates a chord, the algorithm that detects a musical attribute, or sets a tuning system, are all representations of music that are recomposable.

i think what's interesting also is how strangely linked these things are. if you want to add a new track to your song, you're thinking about the tonal stuff, but even the right tonal stuff isn't going to sound good if you're using a sound that doesn't fit with your song. So that begs a very interesting question--are these things really separable? Does what chord you're playing, in some way, include a notion of what sound you're playing it with? all this to suggest that a sound designer, engineer, instrument or software designer... are all also music theorists. and of the best sort--who are reimagining and reinventing ideas about music.

#### Becoming a theorist

now, the defining attribute of a music theorist, the thing that gets you in the door, is something like reflectiveness. you have turned around and looked at what you're doing, seen it in a new way, as something strange and unknown, and began to inquire into it. by the way, this is an aspirational quality of a person in general, and some would say, the truest purpose of education.

  the attitude of a theorist: the point here is to avoid explaining anything. except, perhaps, explaining an ingredient that's composed, in order to compose it, and to allow it to be recomposed. the subtext otherwise is that "this is the way it is." it closes it down rather than opens it up. it makes the idea have power over you, rather than vice versa.

  I also need an argument for why this way of thinking makes the theory more useful, practical, applicable. To a person making music and musical things, not just thinking about it.

and that's where the tricky notion of tradition comes in. tradition, that thing we feel we want to be plugged in to, but that seems somehow not to describe our current experiences. the opposition of tradition and newness. i think this has fallen out of balance, in general, perhaps, but here with respect to music, because of this rift you see in so many forms: "i can improvise but i can't read," "i'm a producer but i don't really know what i'm doing because i don't know theory," i'm design software, so why would i care about xyz..." (flesh that out).

#### Where to begin

i could start at any point in this wide field, from sound design, from music's relationship to mathematics, or from music's relationship to language... and make the argument. but i'm choosing to start with this strange topic we seem to call the "basics" of music theory. these things we think we have to know, these things that seem to come from a far off tradition, perhaps even a tradition that's not been so good to us.

  theory's implied status as the entry into tradition. not that it's the only entry into tradition, but because it has that status. it's the strange thing we think we need to know, that feels strangely outside the immediacy of the tools we use every day. that's the reason we seem to look to it--because *we're looking for a connection to something bigger*. looking into that tension, the opposition that underlies that status.

because to me, that seems like starting at the extremes--now, and then--and the project is to develop a way to turn static poles into a living, churning, evolving practice where we can move freely across the vast expanse of this terrain and continue to use the inventiveness that springs by its own accord from our own intuition--from our own living in our world--to tend to the body of living skills, tools, concepts, knowledge, and extraordinary artifacts of human imagination that we're going to carry forward.

pause on the idea of thinking anew: this is not thinking new thoughts, but thinking thoughts anew (thinking things anew rather than thinking new things). this means a connection of the thoughts that came before, and a reimagining of them in our current lives. it means the thoughts that came immediately before, and of trying to reach further back, as far back as we can. to hold that connection in tension with newness, so that things emerge from it.

the subtitle, thinking music theory anew, is nice, because it also means, obviously, thinking what Music Theory itself means anew, not just thinking its usual contents anew.

#### Tradition

There's a tension between newness and tradition

and a tendency for each to try to discount, deny, supplant (or supercede) the other

in that tension, there's a potential for a really great amount of creativity--for an ongoing state of being creative--and that's what this project is about.

  to draw us deeper into the tradition, to make us more creatively sensitive to the newness.

i have to start with a representation of newness, and a representation of tradition.

newness is going to be current music. because it's pre-categorical, because it has a potential to absorb, contain everything... in a way no other style does.

for tradition, the tradition of thinking about music, especially the theoretical systems (concepts, constructions) that have emerged from that tradition, and that have managed to sustain themselves into our current practice. things like notes, scales, chords.

  part of the project is trying to locate what this tradition of basics even is. it's so hard to pin down, maybe it can't be pinned down. maybe pinning it down isn't the point, maybe pinning it down is the opposite of the point. to carry it forward by opening it up.

both of these representations have percolated their way to the surface of our current practices.

here are some stories that result when newness and tradition are in opposition: "learning music is hard, so we made this innovative thing," or on the other hand, "current music is static--nothing's happening."

  marty's inversion of experience--the existing idea trying to mold the experience, versus the other way around. another form of the opposition.

  something I see happen very often--in the pursuit of newness, a denial of tradition. or in the pursuit of tradition, a denial of newness.

but the idealistic goal: the way of honoring the newness, and the way of honoring the tradition is to pursue holding them into dialogue with each other--that's not an end, but a way, a way of being. and it's a way that generates, of itself, a kind of grounded newness, an innovation that's also deeply rooted.

  innovations are always deeply rooted, but all the better when they're aware that they are, rather than believing or pretending they're not.

  this will open branches into things that aren't considered specifically a part of that tradition: auxiliary paths of newness, but that's not going to be the focus. it's an opportunity, it's something we can recognize and bookmark. timbre, synth stuff, etc.

and that's it, that's an intro. obviously this framing isn't limited to music.

what is the motivation to care about tradition? "experience" is hard to cash out--on a philosophical level, it connects you to something larger than yourself. which is also done through sensitivity to newness. but each construction of a tradition represents an ability (a better word than "skill"), a certain usable, useful power. a construction of tradition is a tool. a tool that in its longevity becomes refined through experience--a refinedness, usefulness that is discoverable. and that's usable across the larger scope where it has evolved. it offers a way of making connections, and those connections can be absorbed into the newness.

sometimes breaking with tradition is necessary--you have to cast off the weight in order to see something in a new way. but then there's another step, which is to use the new thing to recapture the tradition. to bring the tradition to live within the new thing, and thus to transform both. the result of this is that every novelty has the potential to look toward its roots, and to place itself in potentially many different stories.

#### Tradition 2.0 (notation)

on the subject of using current music:

it's interesting to think that i'm locating tradition in the theoretical systems--expressed by music notation--and not in the works. it's reading music, period, thinking about theory, not "reading Beethoven."

that's related to the question i asked about reading books vs reading music--that reading music has this strange intermediary layer, a layer we'd be trying to avoid in the idea of a direct connection with the work, and that begs a comparison between music theory and language, learned implicitly or explicitly. what we do have access to is the sound, but is "reading" a musical work by way of the sound, or the notation--or does it require both? what is an approach that would allow the work to inspire and generate inventive and rational ways of thinking, as the natural world inspires scientific theories--or are these things fundamentally different, because a musical work is a work, whereas the natural world is not. this is a really compelling and important problem. it would seem, if we "study" music, that we're studying music theory, and elevating the work to the status of nature. or otherwise, we're taking the work as the expression of rational and inventive thought, but then have to look to the notation (and thus the theory) to gain access (in the literary sense) to the nature of that thought. this is maybe the big, hidden opportunity of music theory--its potential to bring us from the sound, which is immediately accessible, into a set of problems that potentially frames all these activities of thought--the relationship of invented tools to the natural world (departure of the "perfect fourth" from the harmonic series), the influence of language on meaning (notation on sound), to the ability to train and shape one's own internal experience.  

  (noteworthy that shapes takes a sound-first approach. or does it, if it presents songs within a theoretical framework? is that distinct from a notation? see the *Marlonides*.)

and this is relevant because i'm making an argument that we're accessing the musical tradition through the notation, and through the theory, and positioning earlier works as illustrations or examples of that. so the theory and the notations can be brought to bear on present works, and depth and connection to tradition can arise from that--it's located in the process of thinking, the process of thinking is at the center. not in the work, but in the approach to the work. so you'd be able to access this great amount of depth, really, through any work. and works can become functions of exploring the process of thinking and reflecting, but not subjects.

i think that's why people say "i don't know what i'm doing because I can't read music," and not "i don't know what i'm doing because I don't listen to Schubert."

Holding all these factors in play, asking into them, seeing what they generate--that's the kind of "music theory" we're doing here.
