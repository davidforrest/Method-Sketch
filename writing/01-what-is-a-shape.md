## What Is a Shape?



#### A Scale?

the question is how do we translate the standard musical terminology to this shape, which on the surface looks different, and maybe is different, but maybe in some ways isn't.

the closest thing to a traditional musical concept that this is like is a key signature. the collection of notes that are going to fit. but it's not necessarily key, because key tends to imply tonic, the notes you're pulling toward.

and this is also a little different from key signature in a subtle way, which is that key signature is thinking of notes modified from the letter names, the seven notes of the musical system. the basis of your system is the seven-note system, and then you're adjusting the letters.

This is starting with the keyboard as a visual device as the basis. So in a way, you don't have to think in terms of the seven letter names and modify them, but instead, any of these groupings of keys can become their own version of the white notes of the piano, or the seven letters, and so a note that would be an E-flat can just be its own note, without having to be a version or modification of any other note.

So this is a concept before, or maybe alongside all of that. It can align with key signature, but it doesn't have to.



the first question people with music experience ask: what scale is this? or, isn't this just a scale?

it's not yet a scale, because it doesn't necessarily start or end on one particular note. It's just a collection of notes that you can play in any order or combination.

so it can become different scales, but that's a concept that's further down the road from this. this is closer to a key signature.

so as the songs change, they might use different scales. but the collection of notes will stay the same. So it's an idea that's more general than scale. 

And part of the point is to not think of scale--you're taking the idea of the pool of notes that fit together, and the starting note, and separating those ideas. So this is only the pool of notes that sound good together. 

and that's a very easy, intuitive way to connect with playing music on an instrument. Because you can immediately access your intuition about what sounds good, and you experiment, and get some feedback.



It's not the same *key*, but more like the same key signature. And in fact, a lot of these songs are modal. Which is interesting, because if you categorize by Maj min, that doesn't actually match with the groups of notes that are in the song. So for DJs, for example, you'd have a problem of harmonic mixing.

So what scale is this? it's trying to step back from the idea of scale, and even from key sig, to just collection of notes, so it's a concept that's more general than any of those things yet, and you could derive those things from it.



[ but the shape as a concept that represents what you *might* play ] 

*because it's paired with a song*. this emerges from the combination of the shape and the song, in the world.

since the shape gives you all of the notes that fit in the world of this song, the intuition you have kind of takes over, so you need to rely on, well, what could i play that feels like it's going to blend, to add something... it's not a thinking rule, it's based on your experience of music in your life. the shape is almost a way of accessing that intuition, of giving yourself a way to play with it.

and it's not that *anything* will sound good-- but anything you play is likely to sound good. it's that it gives you just enough so that you will start to play things that sound good intuitively. You already have a lot of musical intuitions just from listening to music throughout your life that you can start to use here.



The concepts that are coming up are scale, key, key signature, maybe mode. 

In a way, what this is trying to do is to zoom out to the most general concept that could lead to any or all of those other concepts.

It's closest to key signature. Key signature says, okay, the staff is mapped ot all of the white notes of the piano, but i'm going to modify it so it has the B-flat in there, too, and that's my collection of notes.

That gives you one of these shapes. This would be the key of six sharps or six flats-- but it isn't that, because it's not referencing the no sharps or no flats key.

So there's something really different in the way of thinking when your baseline isn't the white notes of the piano that are then modified, but rather, your basline is just *this collection of notes*, the shape.

So you could have one of these notes, the middle note of the bottom group of the shape, and I could decide to play one note higher, modify it, an "up" from that note, and in standard terminology, that would be and Ab-sharp, or a G#-sharp, a modified version of a note that's already modified from the white notes of the piano.

So whereas in the standard terminology, you're referencing these layers of context, but this is letting you go from that. you're starting with just this collection of notes. So it's like key signature, but it's not key signature.

Perhaps this is getting ahead a little, but it comes up here: And then scale and mode would be if you take that collection of notes and you start it on one particular one of those notes. 

So if you choose the first top key in the bottom group and you play them in order, you're going to get a major scale, which is a mode, and if you chose any of those notes and you start playing in order, you'll get a mode. The minor mode, the dorian mode..

And this is not *that*, because it's not telling you which note to start on. So it's free of that, too.

So in a song, you might have a song that changes mode, or even in some instances changes key, from something major to something minor, or something dorian to something minor, but it could still stay in the same shape.

So scales can change, modes can change, chords can change, basslines can change. Technically even key signatures could change in some circumstances, and you could still be all in the same shape.

So that's how this is both different, and the same as the standard system. You could start from a shape, and decide to modify it to make a different grouping of notes, and then you're getting something like key signatures. Or you could focus on one note, and you start getting scales or keys.

And another way to put this, is the idea of key. When we ask "what key is this in?," we tend to mean one or the other of two things: one is what note it is pulling toward, what's the starting note, or the root note, or the tonic, or what not; and second is what's the collection of notes that fit in the song.

And those are really two different ideas. So this is starting out by separating those from one another, and dealing just with the collection of notes.

And it's a different perception, skill, way of listning, too--to hear which notes fit. That's different from hearing which note they're all pulling toward. The experience of hearing that a note is or isn't part of the shape, is a different experience than being able to hear which note is the anchor. Different people will hear one or the other of these more or less easily, And yet they're both aspects of this idea of key. 

So one way to look at a shape is as half of a key, and before it's key. 

And why do this? It it a way to help us start improvising without first having to construct all these ideas intellectualy? This is another way to think about what a shape is. It's relying on a keyaboard as a mnemonic device, so you can draw a stroke and remember it immediately.

You're not building the shape by focusing on each note individually, you don't have to name the notes, you just see the stroke, you can remember it, and you can play with it. So in a way, it's bypassing all the intellectual stuff, like learning what a scale is so that you can improvise with it, but you can also think of it as what happens *after* you've learned that stuff, and then you're not thinking about it anymore. 

Because when your'e a very experienced musician, and you're improvising, the experience is very much like this. You're not necessarily thinking, "this is a G," or "that's a major scale" and so forth, although you could certainly turn on that analytical layer if you wanted to. You're just in a context, you're reacting to the music, you're using your intuition to move through it in a way that sounds good to you, and then you might turn on your intellectual layer afterward and ask, what did I do? and what should I do next?

So without having ever played before, at all, you can jump into something of the experience of what a really experienced musician does when they're improvising, and that's really cool. 

This is also an advantage of representing collections of notes with a stroke, rather than by coloring in the individual notes in on the keybaord. It allows you to grasp the whole idea at once, as a single symbol, a  gesture, rather than thinking about the parts that make it up. Which is also a version of bypassing the intellectual stuff at first, of coming from the top down, rather than from the bottom up.



This is efficient. Also, you're doing a theory/concept thing, a listening thing, and you're also doing something physical. There's a way in which this device corresponds to the shape of your hands. Which will be Level 4.  



it builds a lot of stuff, playing with this. you start making connections. you get that foundation of playing. it never feels too easy, you have a shape and a song, and it's kind of infinite. you just get in there and play.

and it's not that you're limited to the shape. at the beginning, we say play the shape, bu it's more a framework. 



#### How to deal with traditional theory?

and be sensitive to this-- it's never making alternative theory. It has to  *be* the tradition of theory, it's accessing the foundations. You get a lot of beginner methods: music lerning is hard, therefore we've thrown all that away and are starting with something totally different. But no, you want something that's hugging the traidiontal theory, trying to find ways into it, if it's relevant.

if it's relevant. In this context, it's not really helpful or relevant to think in terms of scales or note names.  

You don't have to do that. You can let go of all that theoretical stuff. You can turn that on if you want, but you can also turn it off, and just play with the shape.

[how to relate shapes and tradition throughout. in the commentary, keep separated.]



####  the process of learning

Often, there's a promise implied in beginning music lessons. Do this really repetitive, rote thing, and do it so much that eventually it will fall away and you won't need it anymore. And you're like, okay, i kind of trust you. And then you stop taking lesson before that ever happens.

So here, there no transition where you stop thinking of notes and start doing something more intuitive. 

If you're playing with a song, moving between the notes of the shape, following your ear, you're already working in that intuitive way. You're not thinking, "I'm now going to play a G, I'm now going to play an A-flat, where's the A-flat on the keyboard, oh, it's the middle of the three black notes..." instead you play a sound, and maybe have a feeling for which direction you should go next, or you may jump to some other note and listen to what it sound like, then have a sense of whether you should play the next note higher or lower... 

So you're working in this more intuitive way, following contours of melody, and event the contour of the instrument.



####  Guitar Shapes?

Guitarists often think in terms of shapes, but there's a difference here, too. Guitar shapes tend to be the shape of a particular chord structure or scale, and you can move that shape up and down the fretboard.

This is not the shape of some particular piece of musical vocabulary, a musical structure, but rather, it works as a kind of filtering of the entire fretboard into a collection of notes that will fit with a song.

So it's like a scale shape, or a key, but with the same distinctions about how you approach those concepts that are mentioned above.

And the shapes lay out on guitar differently, too, because while the fretboard itself is structurally similar to the keyboard, you access that structure through multiple strings that are each tuned differently. So the guitar is like several keyboards side by side, and staggered. It has its own, different set of diagrammatic constraints.

And the keyboard also naturally divides into two repeating groupings of keys, which both offer a simplified unit for creating the diagram of a shape, but also break the groupings up according to a physical constraint of the instrument, similarly to how string tunings will influence patterns on the guitar that move between different strings.

But all that said, the shape represents a collection of notes that fit together, and this collection is not specific to any instrument whatsoever. It's a musical idea outside of instruments, but that we can access in different ways on different instruments. Here, an instument and a musical symbol become closely linked, as ways of representing a musical concept.



#### compositional devices?

you can think of any music theoretical concept as a little instrument that you can play with, or a little world that you can go in to, that gives you some constraints, some ideas, some things that you can work with. 

And it's a nice, creative way to think of any concept, like key signature. To say, okay, what can i do with this? how to I put myself *in* this concept and what does it afford me? 

Like a compositional device. And you develop a kind of toolset of these concepts. Not that you rely on them entirely, but they're there, and you rely on them sometimes for different purposes. Just like any instrument. You have a different kind of telescope when you want to try to look at Pluto, than when you want to see sun spots. 

Or dance styles, or different kinds of rhythms (swing, bossa nova...) those are like concpetual overlays over the movement, and the movement is intuitive, but you think of the overlay and you have a template for how to move, and then you can play with that template.
