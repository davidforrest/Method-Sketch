## What Is a Shape?



#### A Scale?

the first question people with music experience ask: what scale is this? or, isn't this just a scale?

it's not yet a scale, because it doesn't necessarily start or end on one particular note. It's just a collection of notes that you can play in any order or combination.

so it can become different scales, but that's a concept that's further down the road from this. this is closer to a key signature.

so as the songs change, they might use different scales. but the collection of notes will stay the same. So it's an idea that's more general than scale. 

And part of the point is to not think of scale--you're taking the idea of the pool of notes that fit together, and the starting note, and separating those ideas. So this is only the pool of notes that sound good together. 

and that's a very easy, intuitive way to connect with playing music on an instrument. Because you can immediately access your intuition about what sounds good, and you experiment, and get some feedback.



It's not the same *key*, but more like the same key signature. And in fact, a lot of these songs are modal. Which is interesting, because if you categorize by Maj min, that doesn't actually match with the groups of notes that are in the song. So for DJs, for example, you'd have a problem of harmonic mixing.

So what scale is this? it's trying to step back from the idea of scale, and even from key sig, to just collection of notes, so it's a concept that's more general than any of those things yet, and you could derive those things from it.



[ but the shape as a concept that represents what you *might* play ] 

*because it's paired with a song*. this emerges from the combination of the shape and the song, in the world.

since the shape gives you all of the notes that fit in the world of this song, the intuition you have kind of takes over, so you need to rely on, well, what could i play that feels like it's going to blend, to add something... it's not a thinking rule, it's based on your experience of music in your life. the shape is almost a way of accessing that intuition, of giving yourself a way to play with it.

and it's not that *anything* will sound good-- but anything you play is likely to sound good. it's that it gives you just enough so that you will start to play things that sound good intuitively. You already have a lot of musical intuitions just from listening to music throughout your life that you can start to use here.



The concepts that are coming up are scale, key, key signature, maybe mode. 

In a way, what this is trying to do is to zoom out to the most general concept that could lead to any or all of those other concepts.

It's closest to key signature. Key signature says, okay, the staff is mapped ot all of the white notes of the piano, but i'm going to modify it so it has the B-flat in there, too, and that's my collection of notes.

That gives you one of these shapes. This would be the key of six sharps or six flats-- but it isn't that, because it's not referencing the no sharps or no flats key.

So there's something really different in the way of thinking when your baseline isn't the white notes of the piano that are then modified, but rather, your basline is just *this collection of notes*, the shape.

So you could have one of these notes, the middle note of the bottom group of the shape, and I could decide to play one note higher, modify it, an "up" from that note, and in standard terminology, that would be and Ab-sharp, or a G#-sharp, a modified version of a note that's already modified from the white notes of the piano.

So whereas in the standard terminology, you're referencing these layers of context, but this is letting you go from that. you're starting with just this collection of notes. So it's like key signature, but it's not key signature.

Perhaps this is getting ahead a little, but it comes up here: And then scale and mode would be if you take that collection of notes and you start it on one particular one of those notes. 

So if you choose the first top key in the bottom group and you play them in order, you're going to get a major scale, which is a mode, and if you chose any of those notes and you start playing in order, you'll get a mode. The minor mode, the dorian mode..

And this is not *that*, because it's not telling you which note to start on. So it's free of that, too.

So in a song, you might have a song that changes mode, or even in some instances changes key, from something major to something minor, or something dorian to something minor, but it could still stay in the same shape.

So scales can change, modes can change, chords can change, basslines can change. Technically even key signatures could change in some circumstances, and you could still be all in the same shape.

So that's how this is both different, and the same as the standard system. You could start from a shape, and decide to modify it to make a different grouping of notes, and then you're getting something like key signatures. Or you could focus on one note, and you start getting scales or keys.

And another way to put this, is the idea of key. When we ask "what key is this in?," we tend to mean one or the other of two things: one is what note it is pulling toward, what's the starting note, or the root note, or the tonic, or what not; and second is what's the collection of notes that fit in the song.

And those are really two different ideas. So this is starting out by separating those from one another, and dealing just with the collection of notes.

And it's a different perception, skill, way of listning, too--to hear which notes fit. That's different from hearing which note they're all pulling toward. The experience of hearing that a note is or isn't part of the shape, is a different experience than being able to hear which note is the anchor. Different people will hear one or the other of these more or less easily, And yet they're both aspects of this idea of key. 

So one way to look at a shape is as half of a key, and before it's key. 

And why do this? It it a way to help us start improvising without first having to construct all these ideas intellectualy? This is another way to think about what a shape is. It's relying on a keyaboard as a mnemonic device, so you can draw a stroke and remember it immediately.

You're not building the shape by focusing on each note individually, you don't have to name the notes, you just see the stroke, you can remember it, and you can play with it. So in a way, it's bypassing all the intellectual stuff, like learning what a scale is so that you can improvise with it, but you can also think of it as what happens *after* you've learned that stuff, and then you're not thinking about it anymore. 

Because when your'e a very experienced musician, and you're improvising, the experience is very much like this. You're not necessarily thinking, "this is a G," or "that's a major scale" and so forth, although you could certainly turn on that analytical layer if you wanted to. You're just in a context, you're reacting to the music, you're using your intuition to move through it in a way that sounds good to you, and then you might turn on your intellectual layer afterward and ask, what did I do? and what should I do next?

So without having ever played before, at all, you can jump into something of the experience of what a really experienced musician does when they're improvising, and that's really cool. 

This is also an advantage of representing collections of notes with a stroke, rather than by coloring in the individual notes in on the keybaord. It allows you to grasp the whole idea at once, as a single symbol, a  gesture, rather than thinking about the parts that make it up. Which is also a version of bypassing the intellectual stuff at first, of coming from the top down, rather than from the bottom up.



This is efficient. Also, you're doing a theory/concept thing, a listening thing, and you're also doing something physical. There's a way in which this device corresponds to the shape of your hands. Which will be Level 4.  



it builds a lot of stuff, playing with this. you start making connections. you get that foundation of playing. it never feels too easy, you have a shape and a song, and it's kind of infinite. you just get in there and play.

and it's not that you're limited to the shape. at the beginning, we say play the shape, bu it's more a framework. 



and be sensitive to this-- it's never making alternative theory. It has to  *be* the tradition of theory, it's accessing the foundations. You get a lot of beginner methods: music lerning is hard, therefore we've thrown all that away and are starting with something totally different. But no, you want something that's hugging the traidiontal theory, trying to find ways into it, if it's relevant.

if it's relevant. In this context, it's not really helpful or relevant to think in terms of scales or note names.  

You don't have to do that. You can let go of all that theoretical stuff. You can turn that on if you want, but you can also turn it off, and just play with the shape.

[how to relate shapes and tradition throughout. in the commentary, keep separated.]



the question is how do we translate the standard musical terminology to this shape, which on the surface looks different, and maybe is different, but maybe in some ways isn't.

the closest thing to a traditional musical concept that this is like is a key signature. the collection of notes that are going to fit. but it's not necessarily key, because key tends to imply tonic, the notes you're pulling toward.

and this is also a little different from key signature in a subtle way, which is that key signature is thinking of notes modified from the letter names, the seven notes of the musical system. the basis of your system is the seven-note system, and then you're adjusting the letters.

This is starting with the keyboard as a visual device as the basis. So in a way, you don't have to think in terms of the seven letter names and modify them, but instead, any of these groupings of keys can become their own version of the white notes of the piano, or the seven letters, and so a note that would be an E-flat can just be its own note, without having to be a version or modification of any other note.

So this is a concept before, or maybe alongside all of that. It can align with key signature, but it doesn't have to.

 

####  the process of learning

Often, there's a promise implied in beginning music lessons. Do this really repetitive, rote thing, and do it so much that eventually it will fall away and you won't need it anymore. And you're like, okay, i kind of trust you. And then you stop taking lesson before that ever happens.

So here, there no transition where you stop thinking of notes and start doing something more intuitive. 

If you're playing with a song, moving between the notes of the shape, following your ear, you're already working in that intuitive way. You're not thinking, "I'm now going to play a G, I'm now going to play an A-flat, where's the A-flat on the keyboard, oh, it's the middle of the three black notes..." instead you play a sound, and maybe have a feeling for which direction you should go next, or you may jump to some other note and listen to what it sound like, then have a sense of whether you should play the next note higher or lower... 

So you're working in this more intuitive way, following contours of melody, and event the contour of the instrument.



####  Guitar Shapes?

Guitarists often think in terms of shapes, but there's a difference here, too. Guitar shapes tend to be the shape of a particular chord structure or scale, and you can move that shape up and down the fretboard.

This is not the shape of some particular piece of musical vocabulary, a musical structure, but rather, it works as a kind of filtering of the entire fretboard into a collection of notes that will fit with a song.

So it's like a scale shape, or a key, but with the same distinctions about how you approach those concepts that are mentioned above.

And the shapes lay out on guitar differently, too, because while the fretboard itself is structurally similar to the keyboard, you access that structure through multiple strings that are each tuned differently. So the guitar is like several keyboards side by side, and staggered. It has its own, different set of diagrammatic constraints.

And the keyboard also naturally divides into two repeating groupings of keys, which both offer a simplified unit for creating the diagram of a shape, but also break the groupings up according to a physical constraint of the instrument, similarly to how string tunings will influence patterns on the guitar that move between different strings.

But all that said, the shape represents a collection of notes that fit together, and this collection is not specific to any instrument whatsoever. It's a musical idea outside of instruments, but that we can access in different ways on different instruments. Here, an instument and a musical symbol become closely linked, as ways of representing a musical concept.



####  why does the anchor sound like the anchor?

in some way or another, in the song, the [tonal center] is being emphasized. Possibly in the bass, possibly in the melody, it's probably landing in time on a regular repetition of pulses/beats, in some way that your attention is drawn to it. 

And that can also happen by omitting it when you expect it. If you have notes dancing around it, and where it *should* land, it's not there, that will also emphasize the note.

So if the notes weren't moving in time, there wouldn't be anything that emphasizes the tonal center. And if it were just static, but you had the tonal center as the lowest note, or the highest note, or the loudest note, it would likely draw your attention to that note so that you hear it as the tonal center.

So there's that, and there's also a sense of expectation from stylistic conventions, from what you know from other music you've listened to. For example, there are some songs where the tonal center is ambiguous. . 

But that information is filled in by expectations around other songs in the style. And sometimes, different people will disagree on what the tonal center. 

And tha'ts pretty cool, because then you ahve an excuse to get deeper in to this phenomenon, to train yourself to hear it in more detail. Because if you get to know the particular sound of the second note from the anchor, or the third note, then when you hear a note that sounds like that particular tension, you will know where the tonal center *would* be.

This happens all the time, you'll listen to any particular note in a piece, and it sounds like, say, a fifth away from the tonal center. And when you hear that, you know where the tonal center is, and it might not be where you expected it to be. 

And then you can start to ask very interesting questions--why does it sound like this when, intellectually, my idea of what the key is, or what I'm seeing in the notation tells me something different. And that's the kind of moment where you can really get into some of the most exciting questions of what's going on in a piece of music. 



####  what is the anchor?

[gotye (or any dorian) example: hum the tonic, what note is that (E), and what key signature?] but it's supposed to be "in F" (the major key, or maybe the minor key?) 
but F doesn't sound like the tonal center.

So key signature is something that's bigger than key, as in "key note." So if you take the key signature of "one flat," which this song is in, and you have a song where the tonal center is a "B," then the key signature of one flat gets magnitized to B, and colored to B, and it's B minor. but if the song pulled you to F instead, then it would be F major. And both would be the "key of one flat."

But it will happen in songs that any of the seven notes in the shape can and will be the tonal center. It won't just be strictly major and minor. You'll find a lot of rap/trap tracks where A will be the tonal center here. 

So again this is separating the idea of key into two ideas, two different aspects. Separating the idea of notes that fit together, from the idea of a note they're pulling toward.

And you hear these differently, they're different perceptions, too.



#### key as major or minor (also see wk6)

So we think of key as being always major or minor. It's kind of a binary. You don't ever hear of a "phrygian" key. So if you have this phrygian key song, it would be called "minor". 

A practical example where this gets weird is DJ software that matches songs so that you can do harmonic mixing. Usually also thinks in major/minor, so you'll get a phrygian song tagged as minor, so that when it mixes with another song that's actually the minor mode, it sounds messy. You hear this on the radio a lot, when two songs in a DJ set just don't feel right, in terms of their notes, when they're transitioning from one to the other.

So that's an artifact of major an dminor being higher level descriptors of "lightness" and "heaviness", or "brightness" and "darkness", that describe several possible modes, such that minor and phrygian, and dorian, can all be versions of "Big Minor," and Lydian and Major and Dorian can all be versions of "Big Major".

There's a difference between the major and minor modes, and major as an idea that describes general majorness.



####  natural, harmonic, melodic minor

This is talking about "natural" minor.

With harmonic minor, if you're thinking in this way of context plus tonal center, with harmonic minor, on the seventh note, you move into a different context entirely, and then back when you return to the tonic. You move into the "Dominant" context, and you hear that note as being a third in the Dominant context, and then you come back to hearing minor.

Then melodic minor started to show up with this same progression to Dominant, but from minor. And then you can have modes from melodic minor as well, and they have a different sound.

[example of Alt resolving to dorian, a familiar sound, and Alt is a melodic minor mode]

And that would be a "D augmenteddominant seventh, flat and sharp 9, sharp 11, and maybe flat 13th..." so it starts to break the triadic way of thinking of chords.

so it makes more sense to think of that kind of thing as modal? there's no right way to think of a musical concept. But there are choices. If you think of this as a functionally dominant, then there are a lot of modifications going on. If it's a dominant chord, how can it have an augmented fifth? But it does, or maybe that's the flat 13th? And then it has a flat 9th and a sharp 9th, but the sharp 9th is also a minor third. But it has a major third, because it's Dominant...

It doesn't make sense intellectually in that way. But there's recourse to the idea that there's a collection of notes that fit together, that are pulling toward one note. and tha'ts intuitive. which creates a mode, and this sound, however we voice it, is an expression of the sound of that mode.

So at any moment in music you're listening to, if you freeze the music and say i want to round up, or hum, or play on the piano the seven-ish notes that feel like they fit in this world, and then to find the one note they're magatized toward, those two ideas will give you all the information that would be contained in all of those other symbol systems. 

And with that information, and with that intuition, you can start to make choices about how to name what you hear in those other systems. But you also don't *have* to name them. 

Part of what's cool about playing instruments and using a mnemonic device, is you don't have to think in terms of "what note is this."

And when you're a really fluent reader or improviser, you *dont'* think of what note this is. You're just playing contours inside of a context, following your ear, listening to other people. So you play "that note, that note, that note," and i'm not thinking "that's a D-flat, or in this case a C-sharp," instead, I'm thinking, that button comes after that one, it's making a gesture on the instrument and you're playing and thinking in that way

So if you were a really fluent musician who has learned all this stuff, and internalized it, and forgotten it, you actually are thinking in very much the same way that someone who's never learned any of it, and is just messing around with music videos is thinking about it. So you have a real insight, just as a beginner at keyboard, to feel what it's like to be a really, really experienced keyboard player.



#### jazz? (and layers of tonal context)

Isn't this what a jazz musician does? listens for the tonal center, plays lots of accidentals... that is, what the hell is a jazz musician doing?

We don't need to make a distinction between jazz and otherwise. because a jazz musician is thinking both in terms of the shape and anchor of the whole piece, but also of the changing chords.

So you can get into the world of each changing chord, and those are almost like different key signatures that are changing.

So you can have two situations: a world in which you're playing the same shape, and you give it an anchor note, and you change the anchor note, and these are all different chords. Each with its own anchor, but all those anchors in turn pulling to the anchor of the piece overall.

Or you can have a situation where with new chord, you also change the shape, even if the anchor stays the same. So both the anchor and shape can change, both at the chord level and at the key level. 

So you're pulling toward the tonal center of the whole piece, but you have this other layer of tonal centers, that are like your chord roots. That are pulling toward the tonal center of the piece, but each of *them* is its own little world, where all the notes are pulling toward the root note of the chord, and *then* pulling toward the tonal center of the piece.

And you'll hear these things happening at the same time. You'll hear a note that's infused with "thirdness" *and* "fifthess". It's the third of a chord, but also a fifth relative to the piece overall. And this is a really immediate feeling you can have that gives you picture of the piece you're in, of what's happened before, and perhaps of what you can expect.

These kinds of changes apply just as well to a pop song, or to any music with respect to tonal context, as they do in jazz. These are different ways of stylizing the same ideas, or perhaps, these ideas are generalizations that can apply to any of these musical styles.



####  the name "anchor" and making up names

"Anchor" is not the traditional name for this idea. It's often called "tonal center" or "tonic," or sometimes "key note," or in some cases "root."

In a way, I like being able to make up words in music theory, because this allows you to consider an idea separately from all the associations it may already have.

If i say "anchor," I can make that mean i want to *intentionally* position myself at this note, I want to make myself hear that this note is the note the others are pulling towrad. And if i were to choose to make myself hear a different note, I can do that with some training.

(an example? we did this with Hodie)

That I actively change my perspective and hear a piece in a totally different way tonally just because i've oriented myself to a different  tonal center. It's really cool.



####  function?

So now that we have an anchor, or tonal center, each of the other notes feels like it's pulling toward that tonal center. You really hear this (in Lesson 4?) when you alternate notes with the tonal center.

So there are two things we can do with that. One, we can hear it and use it to structure things we play...



####  matching a shape / abstract songs / ambiguity

So there's that, and there's also a sense of expectation from stylistic conventions, from what you know from other music you've listened to. For example, there are some songs where the tonal center, or even the shape, is ambiguous. There just aren't enough notes in the song, enough information, to tell you *exactly* what's going on. 

But that information is filled in by expectations around other songs in the style. 

And people disagree on what the tonal center. 



####  intuition (or music videos?)

this also makes the interesting point that these sorts of contexts, these worlds of notes are in our ears already, so we're coming to any music we listen to with expectations, established patterns, and a lot of intuitions that in many ways come from our musical surroundings, from what we've grown up with.

and those are patterns that persist (in certain ways) through all music of all people of all time.



####  modal realm vs functional?

i really have to think more about this, because i'm noticing people around me make a stronger distinction between modal thinking and otherwise, and i don't. So i may have to be more explicit about that. perhaps in the modes extra writing.

and it can get even weirder and say that this could apply not only to key, but also to chord. And that chord as a concept is also potentially a combination of the notes that feel like they fit together, and the note they're pulling toward.

a chord symbol (Em) might mean play the specific notes E, G, B, or it might mean that it's the mode minor, and the chord that would happen if you skipped every other note of that chord. Or, if you play any notes of that mode, as a chord structure.



#### compositional devices?

you can think of any music theoretical concept as a little instrument that you can play with, or a little world that you can go in to, that gives you some constraints, some ideas, some things that you can work with. 

And it's a nice, creative way to think of any concept, like key signature. To say, okay, what can i do with this? how to I put myself *in* this concept and what does it afford me? 

Like a compositional device. And you develop a kind of toolset of these concepts. Not that you rely on them entirely, but they're there, and you rely on them sometimes for different purposes. Just like any instrument. You have a different kind of telescope when you want to try to look at Pluto, than when you want to see sun spots. 

Or dance styles, or different kinds of rhythms (swing, bossa nova...) those are like concpetual overlays over the movement, and the movement is intuitive, but you think of the overlay and you have a template for how to move, and then you can play with that template.



#### physical / concepts?

is it different to have an experience with your body, than to think of a gesture in your mind?

The shape is a diagram, so it's an intellectual concept, something you can have in your imagination, and that you can use as a way of abstracting it away from the keyboard and applying it to something like a key signature, or to your voice.

It's also a picture of an instrument that you can play, and that instrument is literally shaped like your hands, with keys that stick up like your fingers stick up. So it's physical. And the physical aspect of it is also diagrammatic. 

So you can have a concept that instantiates as a physical concept on this instrument, that you can also abstract away, and at the same time, you're interacting with music. Maybe not a music video, maybe your'e playing with someone, with a recording,

So there's yet another thing going on, which is that you're hearing these contexts and interacting with them in a perceptual way, that isn't necessarily physical on an instrument or purely conceptual, separately from an experience.

So you ahve all of those things going on: physical, perceptual, intellectual, instrumental... and in a perfect world, they all work together. And when you're building the physical skill, it's also reinforcing the skill that will help you abstract it from the instrument and apply it somewhere else.

So in this way, does your thinking become an instrument?

Say you play with a shape on the keyboard, and then you hear something and you're able to have an account for it, and you're able to sing it, and bring it inside your own body, and then you're able to imagine it *without* singing it, you've instrumentalized yourself. You've actually turned your own musical imagination into an instruemnt, that's also relying on concepts that are instruements.

In any of these cases, you're taking something that feels intuitive, bouncing off of an external, rational thing, whether it's physical or conceptual or whatnot, then bringing it back inside of yourself. And then you have this structured thing that you can work with. 

[cont'd FR music]: If you imagine trying to construct the notes in ratios on a monochord, but with just your voice, you can't do it. There's no way to know, you need to have some kind of external, physical thing to reflect yourself off of, like a monochord, or you need to happen by a blacksmith's shop, or something like that. 

And then, once you've done that, you ahve a rational account for it that you can bring back into your body, and then you can produce the sound of this ratio with your voice. But before you've done that, you can't. 

So that's maybe a very base-level way of imagining what that process is like, and what the relationship of the external conceptt, and the account, and your experience, and the musical output and input, etc. is.   



####  Detection?

This had to be done manually. The idea that you could detect this stuff automatically, but no automatic approach is good enough, reliable enough to really work in a learning context. It has to be right. 

So, for example, there will be songs with only three notes in it, that's the whole song. So there's not enough information in the audio file for a pitchmark detection algorithm to know what the context is.

And it's your brain that fills in the rest. It's an interesting problem of MIR. It also draws on the style. It would be possible to detect, in principle, but it would have to say, for example, this is hip hop, and if it's the same three notes but in a country song, it might be a different shape.



####  Why Software?

 I started working on this project a long time ago, say 2009. Then in 2012-2013, i started doing software because of this exact situation, where if you want to have somebody play along with a song, and a sound, and instrument, etc. all need to be in the same place, it's a technical hurdle and most people can't do it.

You'd need a playlist of songs, your computer, a stereo, controller, etc., set the levels, choose a song... so the only way to do it at that time was on iPad. There wasn't a good enough Web Audio API back in 2012.

So on one screen, you could have a keyboard, music video, sound, playlist, and lesson together. So I started to learn how to do software development as a medium to try to express the idea.

So the iPad app was a start, then this is an early rebuild of that project, but in a web browser, which is much more ubiquitous and accessible than an iPad.



####  Blending the Instrument with the song

It's set for you, becaue one way the song won't sound like it fits is if the instrument doesn't fit with the song. So when that's in place, then you can pay attention to the fit of the notes.

But if the fit is close, you can also fiddle with it--turn the volume up or down a little, try a different sound. That's wading into sound design, which is certainly a part of playing, but it's not the focus right now, we're focusing on the tonal stuff, which generalizes across songs.
