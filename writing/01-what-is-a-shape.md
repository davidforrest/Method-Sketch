**A Scale?**

the first question people with music experience ask: what scale is this? or, isn't this just a scale?

it's not yet a scale, because it doesn't necessarily start or end on one particular note. It's just a collection of notes that you can play in any order or combination.

so it can become different scales, but that's a concept that's further down the road from this. this is closer to a key signature.

so as the songs change, they might use different scales. but the collection of notes will stay the same. So it's an idea that's more general than scale. 

And part of the point is to not think of scale--you're taking the idea of the pool of notes that fit together, and the starting note, and separating those ideas. So this is only the pool of notes that sound good together. 

and that's a very easy, intuitive way to connect with playing music on an instrument. Because you can immediately access your intuition about what sounds good, and you experiment, and get some feedback.



It's not the same *key*, but more like the same key signature. And in fact, a lot of these songs are modal. Which is interesting, because if you categorize by Maj min, that doesn't actually match with the groups of notes that are in the song. So for DJs, for example, you'd have a problem of harmonic mixing.

So what scale is this? it's trying to step back from the idea of scale, and even from key sig, to just collection of notes, so it's a concept that's more general than any of those things yet, and you could derive those things from it.



[ but the shape as a concept that represents what you *might* play ] 



The concepts that are coming up are scale, key, key signature, maybe mode. 

In a way, what this is trying to do is to zoom out to the most general concept that could lead to any or all of those other concepts.

It's closest to key signature. Key signature says, okay, the staff is mapped ot all of the white notes of the piano, but i'm going to modify it so it has the B-flat in there, too, and that's my collection of notes.

That gives you one of these shapes. This would be the key of six sharps or six flats-- but it isn't that, because it's not referencing the no sharps or no flats key.

So there's something really different in the way of thinking when your baseline isn't the white notes of the piano that are then modified, but rather, your basline is just *this collection of notes*, the shape.

So you could have one of these notes, the middle note of the bottom group of the shape, and I could decide to play one note higher, modify it, an "up" from that note, and in standard terminology, that would be and Ab-sharp, or a G#-sharp, a modified version of a note that's already modified from the white notes of the piano.

So whereas in the standard terminology, you're referencing these layers of context, but this is letting you go from that. you're starting with just this collection of notes. So it's like key signature, but it's not key signature.

Perhaps this is getting ahead a little, but it comes up here: And then scale and mode would be if you take that collection of notes and you start it on one particular one of those notes. 

So if you choose the first top key in the bottom group and you play them in order, you're going to get a major scale, which is a mode, and if you chose any of those notes and you start playing in order, you'll get a mode. The minor mode, the dorian mode..

And this is not *that*, because it's not telling you which note to start on. So it's free of that, too.

So in a song, you might have a song that changes mode, or even in some instances changes key, from something major to something minor, or something dorian to something minor, but it could still stay in the same shape.

So scales can change, modes can change, chords can change, basslines can change. Technically even key signatures could change in some circumstances, and you could still be all in the same shape.

So that's how this is both different, and the same as the standard system. You could start from a shape, and decide to modify it to make a different grouping of notes, and then you're getting something like key signatures. Or you could focus on one note, and you start getting scales or keys.

And another way to put this, is the idea of key. When we ask "what key is this in?," we tend to mean one or the other of two things: one is what note it is pulling toward, what's the starting note, or the root note, or the tonic, or what not; and second is what's the collection of notes that fit in the song.

And those are really two different ideas. So this is starting out by separating those from one another, and dealing just with the collection of notes.

And it's a different perception, skill, way of listning, too--to hear which notes fit. That's different from hearing which note they're all pulling toward. And yet they're both aspects of this idea of key. 

So one way to look at a shape is as half of a key, and before it's key. 

And why do this? It it a way to help us start improvising without first having to construct all these ideas intellectualy? This is another way to think about what a shape is. It's relying on a keyaboard as a mnemonic device, so you can draw a stroke and remember it immediately.

You're not building the shape by focusing on each note individually, you don't have to name the notes, you just see the stroke, you can remember it, and you can play with it. So in a way, it's bypassing all the intellectual stuff, like learning what a scale is so that you can improvise with it, but you can also think of it as what happens *after* you've learned that stuff, and then you're not thinking about it anymore. 

Because when your'e a very experienced musician, and you're improvising, the experience is very much like this. You're not necessarily thinking, "this is a G," or "that's a major scale" and so forth, although you could certainly turn on that analytical layer if you wanted to. You're just in a context, you're reacting to the music, you're using your intuition to move through it in a way that sounds good to you, and then you might turn on your intellectual layer afterward and ask, what did I do? and what should I do next?

So without having ever played before, at all, you can jump into something of the experience of what a really experienced musician does when they're improvising, and that's really cool. 

This is also an advantage of representing collections of notes with a stroke, rather than by coloring in the individual notes in on the keybaord. It allows you to grasp the whole idea at once, as a single symbol, a  gesture, rather than thinking about the parts that make it up. Which is also a version of bypassing the intellectual stuff at first, of coming from the top down, rather than from the bottom up.



This is efficient. Also, you're doing a theory/concept thing, a listening thing, and you're also doing something physical. There's a way in which this device corresponds to the shape of your hands. Which will be Level 4.  



it builds a lot of stuff, playing with this. you start making connections. you get that foundation of playing. it never feels too easy, you have a shape and a song, and it's kind of infinite. you just get in there and play.

and it's not that you're limited to the shape. at the beginning, we say play the shape, bu it's more a framework. 



and be sensitive to this-- it's never making alternative theory. It has to  *be* the tradition of theory, it's accessing the foundations. You get a lot of beginner methods: music lerning is hard, therefore we've thrown all that away and are starting with something totally different. But no, you want something that's hugging the traidiontal theory, trying to find ways into it, if it's relevant.

if it's relevant. In this context, it's not really helpful or relevant to think in terms of scales or note names.  

[how to relate shapes and tradition throughout. in the commentary, keep separated.]

 



**Guitar Shapes?**

Guitarists often think in terms of shapes, but there's a difference here, too. Guitar shapes tend to be the shape of a particular chord structure or scale, and you can move that shape up and down the fretboard.

This is not the shape of some particular piece of musical vocabulary, a musical structure, but rather, it works as a kind of filtering of the entire fretboard into a collection of notes that will fit with a song.

So it's like a scale shape, or a key, but with the same distinctions about how you approach those concepts that are mentioned above.

And the shapes lay out on guitar differently, too, because while the fretboard itself is structurally similar to the keyboard, you access that structure through multiple strings that are each tuned differently. So the guitar is like several keyboards side by side, and staggered. It has its own, different set of diagrammatic constraints.

And the keyboard also naturally divides into two repeating groupings of keys, which both offer a simplified unit for creating the diagram of a shape, but also break the groupings up according to a physical constraint of the instrument, similarly to how string tunings will influence patterns on the guitar that move between different strings.

But all that said, the shape represents a collection of notes that fit together, and this collection is not specific to any instrument whatsoever. It's a musical idea outside of instruments, but that we can access in different ways on different instruments. Here, an instument and a musical symbol become closely linked, as ways of representing a musical concept.



 **Detection?**

This had to be done manually. The idea that you could detect this stuff automatically, but no automatic approach is good enough, reliable enough to really work in a learning context. It has to be right. 

So, for example, there will be songs with only three notes in it, that's the whole song. So there's not enough information in the audio file for a pitchmark detection algorithm to know what the context is.

And it's your brain that fills in the rest. It's an interesting problem of MIR. It also draws on the style. It would be possible to detect, in principle, but it would have to say, for example, this is hip hop, and if it's the same three notes but in a country song, it might be a different shape.



**Why Software?**

 I started working on this project a long time ago, say 2009. Then in 2012-2013, i started doing software because of this exact situation, where if you want to have somebody play along with a song, and a sound, and instrument, etc. all need to be in the same place, it's a technical hurdle and most people can't do it.

You'd need a playlist of songs, your computer, a stereo, controller, etc., set the levels, choose a song... so the only way to do it at that time was on iPad. There wasn't a good enough Web Audio API back in 2012.

So on one screen, you could have a keyboard, music video, sound, playlist, and lesson together. So I started to learn how to do software development as a medium to try to express the idea.

So the iPad app was a start, then this is an early rebuild of that project, but in a web browser, which is much more ubiquitous and accessible than an iPad.



**Blending the Instrument with the song**

It's set for you, becaue one way the song won't sound like it fits is if the instrument doesn't fit with the song. So when that's in place, then you can pay attention to the fit of the notes.

But if the fit is close, you can also fiddle with it--turn the volume up or down a little, try a different sound. That's wading into sound design, which is certainly a part of playing, but it's not the focus right now, we're focusing on the tonal stuff, which generalizes across songs.
