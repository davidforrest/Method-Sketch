## Why Music Videos?

i'm trying to work with pitches, but to make that activity about more than pitches.

so we're starting with something infinite and precategorical, especially because it's now. 

- (now means more saturated with meaning than ever before or ever again--and also a certain kind of meaning, not accrued historical, intellectual meaning, but an immediate, intuited, affective meaning)

then making a case for how the pitch domain gives us a way into being rational about that infinite thing.

which will relate in the next commentary to this even more general idea of pitch context--of shape (which does this same thing not only with songs, but with other theoretical concepts...)

and how that is a way of stepping into a world and listening to it, experiencing it, observing it, observing what infinite factors are pulling on and affecting the fixed concept we're paying attention to.

that's the point. that if we can find something common, then that common thing will highlight what's particular about each song, and help us to notice it. 

that's what a theoretical concept is. and when it stops being common, if it stops working, it's time to rethink it.



**outline?**

- learning a song, vs playing with a song. what's different about the experience?
- music around us = basis for our contexts, intuitions (focus rather than structures)
  - evaluating the tradition always in terms of now.
- current music = infinite associations
- accessing that through pitch
  - not limiting to the pitch domain, but listening through it. 
- playing as listening.



Usually when you start learning music, you start by playing some simple song.

- usually you start by learning a song. but here, we're playing along with songs. and not just songs but current music videos. Why?

But here we're starting with a whole bunch of songs. And endless bunch of songs.

And they're not just songs, but they're current songs with music videos.

And we're not just playing them, but we're playing *with* them. 

What's the deal?





**Scraping Current Music**

I scrape music charts every week, I've been doing that for years and years. Some of those sources are more mainstream like Billboard, YouTube, or Spotify charts, others tend more toward a particular style, like Complex, The Fader, and Popjustice, and others are a little more curated, or more indie, like Pitchfork, The New York Times Playlist, and Stereogum.

And all together, regardless of their innumerable styles, genres, levels of popularity, this all fits together into a broad category of "current music." 



They're not of a particular style, just things that have percolated to the top of popular culture by one means or another, either commercially, or because of music critics, lists, so anything that's ever been on Billboard, Pitchfork, HypeMachine, the NYT Playlist and several others shows up here. So the idea is "music in the air."

That's the significance of Justin Bieber to the Western Canon.

So if a song comes up and you don't like it, you can skip it.



the other steps that lead the playlist to be curated?



**The Music Around Us**

One way in which this playlist has a possible significance for [any particular song we might pay attention to] is that it's just music that's in the world around us, in the air, in our experience, it's just the stuff we hear in our lives, and so it's had some kind of effect on us in some way. So it doesn't hurt to consider this as something we're dealing with.



(it draws from the largest environment--our lives. 

or, song/playlist : our lives :: shape/concept/environment : song)



What this is meant to represent is the music in the air around us in the world. It's not a particular style, it's just stuff that's somehow managed to percolate to the top of popular culture in some way. Some of it is kinda offensive, some is not... you can skip over it.



* Why is this significant? It represents, largely something about how you listen to all music. The context through which you're hearing anything. Even if you listen to classical music or whatnot. 

You can hum along with it. 





**Infinite Domains**

One thing interesting about starting with a current song, and moreso a music video, is that there's an infinite amount of stuff in there that we can focus on.

Production stuff (noticed autotune), social cues, timbres of instruments, references to styles, lyrics that mean something to us... there's so much in a song, in music. And instead of dealing with this infinite, open thing, we're filtering our rational account of this thing to the domain of pitch, to something we can sing. And that's something that's happened in the tradition of thinking about music for as long as we have any record.

Autotune wasn't the thing that people grabbed onto in Ancient Greece... because obviously nobody was using autotune yet. But maybe the very particular nuances of the sounds of the strings of the lyre, or the aulos could have been what they focused on--the sound of instruments and how they differ. But they didn't. It was pitch.

And why? Pitch generalizes.



There are infinite domains of things that we could be paying attention to. Music might be about some kind of emotional inflection, about sunset in the music video, or the particular sound of an instrument and how that makes you feel.

But we're focusing instead on this domain of pitch that would generalize from one song





**Pitch Generalized**

in order to play *with* a song:

we were catching on to specific notes in the song, but also doing something way weirder than that--to abstract some collection of notes that don't necessarily occur in the song at that moment and sing them. And we did that, but we'd also latch on to sounds we *did* hear, and move away from them. 

So there's a generalized concept of notes that fit together, that work, and that collection of note would float up out of that particular song, and also out of a lot of other songs, which would give us a way to relate all those songs to each other. Which is a pretty fair reason to have a theoretical concept.

And also something we can use to learn, to get us singing/playing, to get something musical happening.







**intuition**

this also makes the interesting point that these sorts of contexts, these worlds of notes are in our ears already, so we're coming to any music we listen to with expectations, established patterns, and a lot of intuitions that in many ways come from our musical surroundings, from what we've grown up with.

and those are patterns that persist (in certain ways) through all music of all people of all time.



 The take away is that we're not coming into this with no intuitions about music, we're not starting from scratch, we're not learning the basics that we're then building music up from. We're starting with an infinite lot of stuff, and we're trying to build up from that, give an account of it, and make it into concepts that we can think about, work with, and then feed back into that loop of our intuitions. 



Playing (or singing) along shows you that you know a lot of stuff about music already. You're not coming to this experience from scratch, and you're also not building it up from basics. You're starting top down.





**Playing as a way of Listening**

Related to stepping inside the world of a concept. **This is a way that playing with the pitch collection domain can absorb all the infinite other domains, by placing you in the song and allowing you to notice them.**

Also maybe mention here that the instrument is chosen, leveled, etc., in order to focus on this experience. But those choices are other directions this experience can take you, other kinds of listening, other sensitivities to other domains.
