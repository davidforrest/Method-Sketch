## Why Music Videos?


####  intuition (or music videos?)

this also makes the interesting point that these sorts of contexts, these worlds of notes are in our ears already, so we're coming to any music we listen to with expectations, established patterns, and a lot of intuitions that in many ways come from our musical surroundings, from what we've grown up with.

and those are patterns that persist (in certain ways) through all music of all people of all time.
