## The Centered Keyboard



#### physical / concepts?

is it different to have an experience with your body, than to think of a gesture in your mind?

The shape is a diagram, so it's an intellectual concept, something you can have in your imagination, and that you can use as a way of abstracting it away from the keyboard and applying it to something like a key signature, or to your voice.

It's also a picture of an instrument that you can play, and that instrument is literally shaped like your hands, with keys that stick up like your fingers stick up. So it's physical. And the physical aspect of it is also diagrammatic. 

So you can have a concept that instantiates as a physical concept on this instrument, that you can also abstract away, and at the same time, you're interacting with music. Maybe not a music video, maybe your'e playing with someone, with a recording,

So there's yet another thing going on, which is that you're hearing these contexts and interacting with them in a perceptual way, that isn't necessarily physical on an instrument or purely conceptual, separately from an experience.

So you ahve all of those things going on: physical, perceptual, intellectual, instrumental... and in a perfect world, they all work together. And when you're building the physical skill, it's also reinforcing the skill that will help you abstract it from the instrument and apply it somewhere else.

So in this way, does your thinking become an instrument?

Say you play with a shape on the keyboard, and then you hear something and you're able to have an account for it, and you're able to sing it, and bring it inside your own body, and then you're able to imagine it *without* singing it, you've instrumentalized yourself. You've actually turned your own musical imagination into an instruemnt, that's also relying on concepts that are instruements.

In any of these cases, you're taking something that feels intuitive, bouncing off of an external, rational thing, whether it's physical or conceptual or whatnot, then bringing it back inside of yourself. And then you have this structured thing that you can work with. 

[cont'd FR music]: If you imagine trying to construct the notes in ratios on a monochord, but with just your voice, you can't do it. There's no way to know, you need to have some kind of external, physical thing to reflect yourself off of, like a monochord, or you need to happen by a blacksmith's shop, or something like that. 

And then, once you've done that, you ahve a rational account for it that you can bring back into your body, and then you can produce the sound of this ratio with your voice. But before you've done that, you can't. 

So that's maybe a very base-level way of imagining what that process is like, and what the relationship of the external concept, and the account, and your experience, and the musical output and input, etc. is.
