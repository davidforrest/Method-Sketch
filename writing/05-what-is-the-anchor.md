## What is the Anchor?



####  why does the anchor sound like the anchor?

in some way or another, in the song, the [tonal center] is being emphasized. Possibly in the bass, possibly in the melody, it's probably landing in time on a regular repetition of pulses/beats, in some way that your attention is drawn to it. 

And that can also happen by omitting it when you expect it. If you have notes dancing around it, and where it *should* land, it's not there, that will also emphasize the note.

So if the notes weren't moving in time, there wouldn't be anything that emphasizes the tonal center. And if it were just static, but you had the tonal center as the lowest note, or the highest note, or the loudest note, it would likely draw your attention to that note so that you hear it as the tonal center.

So there's that, and there's also a sense of expectation from stylistic conventions, from what you know from other music you've listened to. For example, there are some songs where the tonal center is ambiguous. . 

But that information is filled in by expectations around other songs in the style. And sometimes, different people will disagree on what the tonal center. 

And tha'ts pretty cool, because then you ahve an excuse to get deeper in to this phenomenon, to train yourself to hear it in more detail. Because if you get to know the particular sound of the second note from the anchor, or the third note, then when you hear a note that sounds like that particular tension, you will know where the tonal center *would* be.

This happens all the time, you'll listen to any particular note in a piece, and it sounds like, say, a fifth away from the tonal center. And when you hear that, you know where the tonal center is, and it might not be where you expected it to be. 

And then you can start to ask very interesting questions--why does it sound like this when, intellectually, my idea of what the key is, or what I'm seeing in the notation tells me something different. And that's the kind of moment where you can really get into some of the most exciting questions of what's going on in a piece of music. 



####  what is the anchor?

[gotye (or any dorian) example: hum the tonic, what note is that (E), and what key signature?] but it's supposed to be "in F" (the major key, or maybe the minor key?) 
but F doesn't sound like the tonal center.

So key signature is something that's bigger than key, as in "key note." So if you take the key signature of "one flat," which this song is in, and you have a song where the tonal center is a "B," then the key signature of one flat gets magnitized to B, and colored to B, and it's B minor. but if the song pulled you to F instead, then it would be F major. And both would be the "key of one flat."

But it will happen in songs that any of the seven notes in the shape can and will be the tonal center. It won't just be strictly major and minor. You'll find a lot of rap/trap tracks where A will be the tonal center here. 

So again this is separating the idea of key into two ideas, two different aspects. Separating the idea of notes that fit together, from the idea of a note they're pulling toward.

And you hear these differently, they're different perceptions, too.



#### key as major or minor (also see wk6)

So we think of key as being always major or minor. It's kind of a binary. You don't ever hear of a "phrygian" key. So if you have this phrygian key song, it would be called "minor". 

A practical example where this gets weird is DJ software that matches songs so that you can do harmonic mixing. Usually also thinks in major/minor, so you'll get a phrygian song tagged as minor, so that when it mixes with another song that's actually the minor mode, it sounds messy. You hear this on the radio a lot, when two songs in a DJ set just don't feel right, in terms of their notes, when they're transitioning from one to the other.

So that's an artifact of major an dminor being higher level descriptors of "lightness" and "heaviness", or "brightness" and "darkness", that describe several possible modes, such that minor and phrygian, and dorian, can all be versions of "Big Minor," and Lydian and Major and Dorian can all be versions of "Big Major".

There's a difference between the major and minor modes, and major as an idea that describes general majorness.



####  natural, harmonic, melodic minor

This is talking about "natural" minor.

With harmonic minor, if you're thinking in this way of context plus tonal center, with harmonic minor, on the seventh note, you move into a different context entirely, and then back when you return to the tonic. You move into the "Dominant" context, and you hear that note as being a third in the Dominant context, and then you come back to hearing minor.

Then melodic minor started to show up with this same progression to Dominant, but from minor. And then you can have modes from melodic minor as well, and they have a different sound.

[example of Alt resolving to dorian, a familiar sound, and Alt is a melodic minor mode]

And that would be a "D augmenteddominant seventh, flat and sharp 9, sharp 11, and maybe flat 13th..." so it starts to break the triadic way of thinking of chords.

so it makes more sense to think of that kind of thing as modal? there's no right way to think of a musical concept. But there are choices. If you think of this as a functionally dominant, then there are a lot of modifications going on. If it's a dominant chord, how can it have an augmented fifth? But it does, or maybe that's the flat 13th? And then it has a flat 9th and a sharp 9th, but the sharp 9th is also a minor third. But it has a major third, because it's Dominant...

It doesn't make sense intellectually in that way. But there's recourse to the idea that there's a collection of notes that fit together, that are pulling toward one note. and tha'ts intuitive. which creates a mode, and this sound, however we voice it, is an expression of the sound of that mode.

So at any moment in music you're listening to, if you freeze the music and say i want to round up, or hum, or play on the piano the seven-ish notes that feel like they fit in this world, and then to find the one note they're magatized toward, those two ideas will give you all the information that would be contained in all of those other symbol systems. 

And with that information, and with that intuition, you can start to make choices about how to name what you hear in those other systems. But you also don't *have* to name them. 

Part of what's cool about playing instruments and using a mnemonic device, is you don't have to think in terms of "what note is this."

And when you're a really fluent reader or improviser, you *dont'* think of what note this is. You're just playing contours inside of a context, following your ear, listening to other people. So you play "that note, that note, that note," and i'm not thinking "that's a D-flat, or in this case a C-sharp," instead, I'm thinking, that button comes after that one, it's making a gesture on the instrument and you're playing and thinking in that way

So if you were a really fluent musician who has learned all this stuff, and internalized it, and forgotten it, you actually are thinking in very much the same way that someone who's never learned any of it, and is just messing around with music videos is thinking about it. So you have a real insight, just as a beginner at keyboard, to feel what it's like to be a really, really experienced keyboard player.



#### jazz? (and layers of tonal context)

Isn't this what a jazz musician does? listens for the tonal center, plays lots of accidentals... that is, what the hell is a jazz musician doing?

We don't need to make a distinction between jazz and otherwise. because a jazz musician is thinking both in terms of the shape and anchor of the whole piece, but also of the changing chords.

So you can get into the world of each changing chord, and those are almost like different key signatures that are changing.

So you can have two situations: a world in which you're playing the same shape, and you give it an anchor note, and you change the anchor note, and these are all different chords. Each with its own anchor, but all those anchors in turn pulling to the anchor of the piece overall.

Or you can have a situation where with new chord, you also change the shape, even if the anchor stays the same. So both the anchor and shape can change, both at the chord level and at the key level. 

So you're pulling toward the tonal center of the whole piece, but you have this other layer of tonal centers, that are like your chord roots. That are pulling toward the tonal center of the piece, but each of *them* is its own little world, where all the notes are pulling toward the root note of the chord, and *then* pulling toward the tonal center of the piece.

And you'll hear these things happening at the same time. You'll hear a note that's infused with "thirdness" *and* "fifthess". It's the third of a chord, but also a fifth relative to the piece overall. And this is a really immediate feeling you can have that gives you picture of the piece you're in, of what's happened before, and perhaps of what you can expect.

These kinds of changes apply just as well to a pop song, or to any music with respect to tonal context, as they do in jazz. These are different ways of stylizing the same ideas, or perhaps, these ideas are generalizations that can apply to any of these musical styles.



####  the name "anchor" and making up names

"Anchor" is not the traditional name for this idea. It's often called "tonal center" or "tonic," or sometimes "key note," or in some cases "root."

In a way, I like being able to make up words in music theory, because this allows you to consider an idea separately from all the associations it may already have.

If i say "anchor," I can make that mean i want to *intentionally* position myself at this note, I want to make myself hear that this note is the note the others are pulling towrad. And if i were to choose to make myself hear a different note, I can do that with some training.

(an example? we did this with Hodie)

That I actively change my perspective and hear a piece in a totally different way tonally just because i've oriented myself to a different  tonal center. It's really cool.



####  function?

So now that we have an anchor, or tonal center, each of the other notes feels like it's pulling toward that tonal center. You really hear this (in Lesson 4?) when you alternate notes with the tonal center.

So there are two things we can do with that. One, we can hear it and use it to structure things we play...



####  modal realm vs functional?

i really have to think more about this, because i'm noticing people around me make a stronger distinction between modal thinking and otherwise, and i don't. So i may have to be more explicit about that. perhaps in the modes extra writing.

and it can get even weirder and say that this could apply not only to key, but also to chord. And that chord as a concept is also potentially a combination of the notes that feel like they fit together, and the note they're pulling toward.

a chord symbol (Em) might mean play the specific notes E, G, B, or it might mean that it's the mode minor, and the chord that would happen if you skipped every other note of that chord. Or, if you play any notes of that mode, as a chord structure.



####  matching a shape / abstract songs / ambiguity

So there's that, and there's also a sense of expectation from stylistic conventions, from what you know from other music you've listened to. For example, there are some songs where the tonal center, or even the shape, is ambiguous. There just aren't enough notes in the song, enough information, to tell you *exactly* what's going on. 

But that information is filled in by expectations around other songs in the style. 

And people disagree on what the tonal center.
