## About Shapes

What does it *feel like* to be fluent in music? What does a skilled musician experience when they play their instrument, or when they use musical symbols? And how close can we come to that feeling, right from the beginning?

What if the "basics" of music aren't the notes, scales, chords, keys, intervals, or the correct techniques for playing an instrument&mdash;but instead, are the intuitions that *generated* all those ideas and techniques in the first place?

If that's the case, then you already have the basics. And you're not by any means at the beginning. You've more likely arrived to a place where you feel the need to connect your experience to some musical tools and techniques&mdash;to bounce your intuitions off of something outside yourself, so that you can develop and refine those intuitions.

The difficulty is that so many of the tools that work so remarkably well for musicians are designed to do exactly that&mdash;to work remarkably well&mdash;but not to show you *how* they work. Music notation, for example, takes layers upon layers of different ways of experiencing music: it's contexts, it's departures from those contexts, it's events in pitch and in time, the relationships between those events... and compiles them into a single, readable surface layer that lets musicians navigate any or all of these aspects at once, as they wish.

But when we encounter music notation for the first time, all we can see is its surface layer, not all the layers beneath it. And so we're presented with our very same question about the basics: do we start by learning the individual notes, one by one, until they eventually, hopefully, begin to transform into something greater than themselves? Or can we start from some of those deeper layers, that are closer to what we already understand intuitively, and are ultimately the source of that surface layer?

We absolutely can. But this means that the symbols, tools, and techniques we work with at first will have to look a little different than you might expect, because each will be focused more closely on representing its own particular aspect of musical experience. And they'll also need to change their form along the way, and to be replaced by different symbols, tools, and techniques that gradually begin to connect together and resemble our more familiar ideas about music. In short, we have to be playful and creative, not just with our music, but with our ways of *understanding* music.

Shapes is an example of how to approach musical basics in this way. And there are no doubt as many other ways into these questions as there are ways to be creative. But since you're here, I'd like to show you around, as an invitation to try this experience for yourself.



### A Brief Tour

This tour begins by watching the first lesson, which is my favorite way to introduce Shapes:


<style>
.embed-container {
    position: relative;
    padding-bottom: 56.25%;
    height: 0;
    overflow: hidden;
    max-width: 100%;
  }
  iframe{
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
  }
</style>
<div class='embed-container'>

</div>


And before we go on, let's pause here so you have a chance to try it out. Because it's only through the experience that you'll begin to have a real sense for what Shapes is about.

(Really, give it a try&mdash;it's fun!)



Some of the most fundamental 

So many of the most fundamental ideas that run throughout Shapes are present in this first lesson:

- the focus isn't on what to play, but what's possible to play. 
- it's drawing on intuitions you already have. wrong notes, and having a sense of what to play next.
- creates a concept that's an environment to explore within.





you could continue, but a tour departs from just starting because it's an overview. so here's a map!

And with that bit of context, hereâ€™s a handy map of the whole method:

<img src="../map/map.png" alt="shapes method map" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 100%; height: auto;">


<br>
Youâ€™ll find the first lesson where the land of Symbols overlaps with the land of Imagination. The shape draws on a learnerâ€™s implicit knowledge and makes it possible to improvise along with songs right away, to access a musical imagination that's already very active.

Of course, the shape is a kind of diagram on an instrument, and so the path continues through the land of Symbols, into the land of Instruments, and then into a land where the instrument begins to disappear, to become internalized as the rational side of a learner's musical imagination.

And like so, this path winds around again and again through the lands of Symbols, Instruments, and Imagination until eventually it falls clear off the edge of the map, and the learner has to go find a different world to explore.

But before then, this path will have weaved its way through five distinct lesson sequences, and Iâ€™d like to give you a brief overview of each of those. They are:

- Playing With Songs
- Tactile Reading
- Chord & Key Levels
- Tonescapes & Tensions
- and Reading Imagery



ðŸš§ Under Construction: Hard Hat Area ðŸš§

#### Playing With Songs

(...overview...)

(...and point to commentaries, too...)

[Lesson 1]() introduces a shape. [Lesson 2]() and [3]() expand to a full group of shapes and give them names. [Lesson 6]() introduces the anchor note as a way to structure what you play. [Lesson 8]() shows you how to figure out the shape on your own. [Lesson 9]() introduces a form of staff notation. [Lesson 11]() introduces three additional groups of shapes that match the full vocabulary of chord names.

#### Tactile Reading

(...overview...)

[Lesson 4]() introduces a single fingering pattern that allows you to play hands together in any shape, starting on any note. [Lesson 12]() uses this pattern to begin reading a relative notation along with songs, in a way that feels like playing Guitar Hero. [Lesson 18]() and [23]() expand the range of shapes and add features to the notation. [Lesson 27]() replaces pulse dots with rhythmic note symbols. And [Lesson 30]() gives a way to notate outside the shape.

#### Chord & Key Levels

(overview)

[Lesson 5]() introduces the anchor note as a way of structuring the other notes of the shape. [Lesson 7]() shows that changing bass notes along with any other notes of a shape create the recognizable framework for a song. And [Lesson 10]() introduces changing shapes, anchors, and bass notes.

#### Tonescapes & Tensions

(overview)

Designed to be a standalone ear training resource. And best if done in sequence with Reading Imagery. 

[Lesson 13]() introduces a tonescape, a sound as though all the songs that fit with a single shape were boiled into a soup, and recognition of the anchor, one note higher, and one note lower within the tonescape. [Lesson 15]() expands to two notes higher and lower. [Lesson 17]() brings in octave equivalence and switches from higher/lower names to number names. [Lesson 19]() and [21]() introduce different moods that result from the sum of tensions to the anchor. Lessons [24](), [25](), and [28]() expand to recognition of all moods and all tensions. And [Lesson 31]() removes the tonescape.

#### Reading Imagery

(overview)

Actively imagine sounds in tonescapes rather than recognizing them. [Lesson 14]() introduces imagery, [Lesson 16]() uses notation to draw two additional notes out of the tonescape. [Lesson 20]() expands to three moods. [Lesson 22](), [26](), and [29]() expand to hearing all tensions in all moods. And [Lesson 32]() is free play imagery in all moods.

...And so hopefully, this tour will pique your interest to jump in and give it a try, and will have given you a sense of where you might like to explore first.

### About The Medium



of a method, perhaps, and of a method embedded in software. 

####  Why Software?

if you want to have somebody play along with a song, and a sound, and instrument, etc., all need to be in the same place, it's a technical hurdle and a barrier to entry for many learners.

You'd need a playlist of songs, your computer, a stereo, controller, etc., set the levels, choose a song... so the only way to do it at that time was on iPad. There wasn't a good enough Web Audio API even a few years back...

So on one screen, you could have a keyboard, music video, sound, playlist, and lesson together. So this was part of making an experience of the idea possible... now there's the technology, easily, to do that in a web browser.



 But you don't want the technology to do too much for you...

Also Include in the medium:
- the third part is zippering this all together, teaching, adjusting, refining, tweaking...
- teaching through it, seeing what works...
- which goes back to the basics method, it's scope, purpose
- why it mattered for me to put it in a form


#### Data Model

the analysis model for songs developed alongside the ideas and needs of the method. 

pedagogical choices behind design of the software, not only the interface...



####  Detection?

This had to be done manually. The idea that you could detect this stuff automatically, but no automatic approach is good enough, reliable enough to really work in a learning context. It has to be right. 

So, for example, there will be songs with only three notes in it, that's the whole song. So there's not enough information in the audio file for a pitchmark detection algorithm to know what the context is.

And it's your brain that fills in the rest. It's an interesting problem of MIR. It also draws on the style. It would be possible to detect, in principle, but it would have to say, for example, this is hip hop, and if it's the same three notes but in a country song, it might be a different shape.



####  Blending the Instrument with the song

Then the instrument is initially  set for you, because one way the song won't sound like it fits is if the instrument doesn't fit with the song. So when that's in place, then you can pay attention to the fit of the notes.

But if the fit is close, you can also fiddle with it--turn the volume up or down a little, try a different sound. That's wading into sound design, which is certainly a part of playing, but it's not the focus right now, we're focusing on the tonal stuff, which generalizes across songs.
