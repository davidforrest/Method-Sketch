## About Shapes

What does it *feel like* to be fluent in music? What does a skilled musician experience when they play their instrument, or when they use musical symbols? And how close can we come to that feeling, right from the beginning?

What if the "basics" of music aren't the notes, scales, chords, keys, intervals, or the correct techniques for playing an instrument&mdash;but instead, are the intuitions that *generated* all those ideas and techniques in the first place?

If that's the case, then you already have the basics. And you're not by any means at the beginning. You've more likely arrived to a place where you feel the need to connect your experience to some musical tools and techniques&mdash;to bounce your intuitions off of something outside yourself, so that you can develop and refine those intuitions.

The difficulty is that so many of the tools that work so remarkably well for musicians are designed to do exactly that&mdash;to work remarkably well&mdash;but not to show you *how* they work. Music notation, for example, takes layers upon layers of different ways of experiencing music: it's contexts, it's departures from those contexts, it's events in pitch and in time, the relationships between those events... and compiles them into a single, readable surface layer that lets musicians navigate any or all of these aspects at once, as they wish.

But when we encounter music notation for the first time, all we can see is its surface layer, not all the layers beneath it. And so we're presented with our very same question about the basics: do we start by learning the individual notes, one by one, until they eventually, hopefully, begin to transform into something greater than themselves? Or can we start from some of those deeper layers, that are closer to what we already understand intuitively, and are ultimately the source of that surface layer?

We absolutely can. But this means that the symbols, tools, and techniques we work with at first will have to look a little different than you might expect, because each will be focused more closely on representing its own particular aspect of musical experience. And they'll also need to change their form along the way, and to be replaced by different symbols, tools, and techniques that gradually begin to connect together and resemble our more familiar ideas about music. In short, we have to be playful and creative, not only with our music, but with our ways of *understanding* music.

Shapes is an example of how to approach musical basics in this way. And there are no doubt as many other possibilities as there are ways to be playful and creative. But since we've landed here, I'd like to show you around, and invite you to try out this experience for yourself.

### A Brief Tour

I'll begin our tour by showing you the first lesson, which is my favorite way to introduce Shapes:

Before we go on, let's pause here so you have a chance to try it out. Because it's through the experience of playing that you'll really start to understand what Shapes is about.

<a href="https://shapesmusic.github.io/Player-Sketch/a-shape" target="_blank">Go to the Lesson 1 Playlist</a> 

<br><br>

Many of the most foundational principles in Shapes are already present in this first lesson. For example:

- **The focus isn't on what to play, but on what's *possible* to play.**

	Rather than learning a song's melody, chords, and so on, you begin by playing with the materials that give rise to those kinds of ideas. The shape represents a field of possibilities, and the song animates those possibilities, inviting you into a conversation with them.

- **It draws on pre-existing intuitions.**

	Hearing when a note doesn't fit is a very powerful phenomenon. It means that you also know which notes *do* fit, even if you haven't yet organized that knowledge into a concept that you can name. You also have a sense for what to play next, and that points to a kind of intuition that extends far beyond the domain of notes, and that may resist explanation altogether.

- **It presents a concept as an environment you can explore within.**

	At first, the shape is represented in terms of a playable instrument&mdash;the keyboard. But this sets up an orientation to musical concepts more generally: that you can approach any concept&mdash;a chord symbol, a musical form, even a single note&mdash;as a little world that you can step inside of, that's designed to show you some particular aspect of music, by offering you a way to experience it.

<br>And with that bit of context, we can zoom out from the immediate experience of Shapes, and look at an overview map of the whole method:

<br>
<img src="../map/map.png" alt="shapes method map" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 100%; height: auto;">

<br>

Youâ€™ll find the first lesson where the land of Symbols overlaps with the land of Imagination. The shape, after all, is a musical symbol which, when paired with a song, gives your musical imagination permission to take over.

The shape is also a diagram on an instrument, and so the path continues through the land of Symbols, into the land of Instruments, and then into a land where instruments begin to disappear, to become internalized as the rational side of your musical imagination.

And like so, this path winds around again and again through the lands of Symbols, Instruments, and Imagination until eventually it falls clear off the edge of the map, and you'll have to go find a different world to explore.

But before then, you will have weaved your way through five distinct sequences of lessons, and Iâ€™d like to tell you a little about what you'll find in each. They are:

- Playing With Songs
- Tactile Reading
- Chord & Key Levels
- Tonescapes & Tensions
- and Reading Imagery

<br><br>

ðŸš§ Under Construction: I'm collecting what stands out most on a pass through all the lessons and commentaries, and will come back to finish this section last. ðŸš§



What matters about the sequences overall:

- That the path spirals through them, rather than completing each in order. This means the focus is on neither a particular concept or a particular skill, but on how the concept develops through different ways of using it, and how different experiences can develop from the same concept.
- This means the boundaries between these sequences are porous, and the skills are integrated. The Chord & Key Levels sequence, for example, is also very much about Playing With Songs. 
- This overview is a total spoiler alert. If you'd like to be surprised and delighted by what shows up in each new lesson, please [skip over this part](#about-the-medium)!



#### Playing With Songs

What matters:

- You've already gone through Lesson 1, so you know how a shape fits with a song.
- This sequence is about getting the hang of playing, and internalizing the shapes. It gradually draws you into more nuanced listening, and begins to incorporate ways to make your playing feel less random, while still following your intuitions.

[Lesson 1]() introduces a shape. [Lesson 2]() and [3]() expand to a full group of shapes and give them names. [Lesson 6]() introduces the anchor note as a way to structure what you play. [Lesson 8]() shows you how to figure out the shape on your own. [Lesson 9]() introduces a form of staff notation. [Lesson 11]() introduces three additional groups of shapes that show up occasionally in songs.

<br><br>

#### Tactile Reading

What matters:

- Having a fingering guideline is similar to bringing structure to your playing. It supports and enhances the feeling of playing intuitively, and it makes you feel more connected to the instrument.
- Reading is mobilized here as a way to take the fingering pattern through all of the shapes, to get to know the instrument tactilely. 
- The notation gives you exact notes to play, but you can play these same notes with any song, at any point in the song. So it still has the feeling of more freely *playing with* the song. This also allows the notation to focus on notational and tactile concepts without having to represent any particular song. This makes it very efficient.

[Lesson 4]() introduces a single fingering pattern that allows you to play hands together in any shape, starting on any note. [Lesson 12]() uses this pattern to begin reading a relative notation along with songs, in a way that feels like playing Guitar Hero. [Lesson 18]() and [23]() expand the range of shapes and add features to the notation. [Lesson 27]() replaces pulse dots with rhythmic note symbols. And [Lesson 30]() gives a way to notate outside the shape.

<br><br>

#### Chord & Key Levels

What matters:

- In one sense, this is part of the playing sequence. But it is really the theoretical heart of the method. It shows that the shape and anchor work at two different levels of perception, and so need to be two separate concepts, rather than a hybrid concept like "key."

[Lesson 5]() introduces the anchor note as a way of structuring the other notes of the shape. [Lesson 7]() shows that changing bass notes along with any other notes of a shape create the recognizable framework for a song. And [Lesson 10]() introduces changing shapes, anchors, and bass notes.

<br><br>

#### Tonescapes & Tensions

What matters:

- A tonescape represents a shape abstracted from an instrument. As such, it is internalized, and generalized to apply to any potential instrument.
- The tonescape is also a sound. The sound of a complete tonal context, a field of potential notes, experienced all at once. That's very strange.
- It serves the role of an instrument. You can use it as a tool to work with the individual notes it contains, and to do so without separating those individual notes from their context.
- It develops recognition of tensions to the anchor, and of moods (the combination of shape and anchor)
- The Tonescapes and Imagery sequences are designed to work as a standalone ear training resource.

[Lesson 13]() introduces a tonescape, a sound as though all the songs that fit with a single shape were boiled into a soup, and recognition of the anchor, one note higher, and one note lower within the tonescape. [Lesson 15]() expands to two notes higher and lower. [Lesson 17]() brings in octave equivalence and switches from higher/lower names to number names. [Lesson 19]() and [21]() introduce different moods that result from the sum of tensions to the anchor. Lessons [24](), [25](), and [28]() expand to recognition of all moods and all tensions. And [Lesson 31]() removes the tonescape.

<br><br>

#### Reading Imagery

What matters:

- The tonescape is a complex sound that you intuitively begin trying to parse. This is experienced as changes of various kinds in an unchanging sound.
- Beginning to identify and then to actively control these changes develops the skill of imagining sounds clearly in your mind's ear. So this sequence is about using the tonescape to build a playable internal instrument.
- Reading is used here to represent which sounds to actively imagine in the tonescape. It develops the skill of silently reading to yourself, and reinforces the staff as representing a mood (shape and anchor).

Actively imagine sounds in tonescapes rather than recognizing them. [Lesson 14]() introduces imagery, [Lesson 16]() uses notation to draw two additional notes out of the tonescape. [Lesson 20]() expands to three moods. [Lesson 22](), [26](), and [29]() expand to hearing all tensions in all moods. And [Lesson 32]() is free play imagery in all moods.

<br>

So hopefully, this overview will have piqued your interest to jump in and give it a try, and will have given you a sense of which areas of the map you might like to explore first.

### About The Medium

By now, we've started to get a sense for the expansiveness of the intuitions that underly our musical basics&mdash;for their potential to generate ideas that we can use to shape and refine our experience of music.

But it's also worth mentioning that those intuitions are also at work in innumerably many other domains of music&mdash;some that we're aware of and some that we're not&mdash;and all of these domains play a part in the concepts and experiences we've placed at the center of our focus.

For example, in order for a note to sound like it fits with a song, we have to take for granted that the sound of the instrument also blends with the sound of the song. If the choice of instrument doesn't fit with the style of the song, or if the volume is far too loud or soft, or if you are playing in an extreme register, what you play won't feel like it blends with the song, even if the notes, when abstracted from all of those considerations, do fit.

So, in an alternative approach to musical basics, the notes could have been what's taken for granted, and the focus on our intuitions could involve adjusting the volume of the instruments, and perhaps learning to recognize and play with deeper parameters of the signal chain from which the sound itself is composed.

In either of these scenarios...











####  Detection? (Process)

This had to be done manually. The idea that you could detect this stuff automatically, but no automatic approach is good enough, reliable enough to really work in a learning context. It has to be right. 

So, for example, there will be songs with only three notes in it, that's the whole song. So there's not enough information in the audio file for a pitchmark detection algorithm to know what the context is.

And it's your brain that fills in the rest. It's an interesting problem of MIR. It also draws on the style. It would be possible to detect, in principle, but it would have to say, for example, this is hip hop, and if it's the same three notes but in a country song, it might be a different shape.
