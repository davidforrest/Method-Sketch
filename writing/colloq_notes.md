so what happens? innovation! grid! or joni mitchell!
but then still wants connection to tradition
"i can play but don't know what i'm doing" (it's not real)

here's where shapes is concerned (the challenge):
think of a current learner…
keep the connection to intuition, stay in the fluency space.
while reamaining connected to the tradition
example: experience of notation vs of an aspect of notation.
simplified vs aspect of the complex whole (contour, etc)
open radical flexibility in the concept, appears as a new concept.
opens a connection beyond notation, but without losing the connection to notation
can also rebuild the traditional concept. or something else. modularized
so the experience / presentation / access becomes involved in the design of the concept
the experience of the resulting concept is very different

**Structure of this talk?** so i'm going to start by giving a little (theory-forward) framing, then four short demos with questions these bring up for me, then i'm hoping we can have a conversation.

### Intro / Framing

**What is it?** Shapes is a beginner music learning method. It's speaking to someone who says "I love music but I wish I could play&mdash;where should I start?"

**What's the heart of it?** It's focus is on the *feeling* of musical fluency. 

**What is "fluency?"** The feeling of fluency means a feeling of effortless connection between musical intuitions and musical concepts.

a language analogy is really common in music learning. you can hear someone say something you can repeat it, write it, read it, change it... so you have a real facility with all that material, and in music that kind of relationship between intuitive understanding and rational concepts is always the goal.

**Established concepts.** Almost always, though, methods tend to take the musical concepts more or less for granted, and to focus their attention on particular ways of presenting (or employing) those concepts. 

A Suzuki violinist may begin by playing a familiar song by ear, but there's no question about whether the notes they're playing can have names, or if the song is in a key, or that it will eventually be represented by music notation, etc. It's not really about that. In Dalcroze Eurythmics, we may be dancing around the room creating an embodied understanding of a concept of meter or measure, but those concepts themselves are never in question. they're established. and it's not about that. the focus is on something other than the concepts themselves. There are nuances in how you might understand a concept that arise from how it's presented, but the concept itself is stable.

**Emerging**

This will get interesting, because Shapes *is* concerned with the concepts, but it's also not *about* that. it's about the feeling of fluency. It's about the *relationship* between the intuitive experience and the concept.

This is where the paradigm of "playing by ear" vs "reading notes" comes in. This highlights a tension&mdash;a tension that's always been there&mdash;between what's emerging and what's established.

Playing by ear represents intuition. it comes from sensitivity to the musical environment around us. it represents the bleeding edge of newness (yeah, unpack that)

And reading notes represents tradition. because music notation, really, is a symbol system, a document, that embeds all of our established concepts. 

back to the idea of fluency. a pedagogical problem is that notation is unbelievably well-suited to that feeling when you know it, because it's so flexible, there's so much so deeply embedded in it... but for a newcomer, that same flexibility makes it quite baffling, contradictory, a conflict of intuition. makes you wonder how the experienced reader got there! by really hard, rote work, then by magic?



**designing new concepts**

so what do you do about this, especially when the level of tradition embedded in the notation grows ever deeper! well on one hand you can look at an entire landscape of emerging interfaces and concepts. look at a push, or a launchpad! or a redesign of the notation system. an impulse to redesign a concept so it matches more closely with our intuitions. This is good! 

similarly if you teach yourself guitar by your own wacky means...

And yet for most people, it's not entirely satisfying. This comes up when you'll hear an absolutely world class musician say something like, yeah, but I don't really know what I'm doing. or, but I can't read music. 

I mean, in some sense, this is a narrative problem. of course you know what you're doing! Anyone who does anything intuitively KNOWS what they're doing, only in the kind of epistemic medium of *intuition.* you're missing the *story* that connects the intuition to the tradition. 

And that's a very deep story. On one hand, you can look at the Push and say, okay, this thing is the product of a tradition: there was the step sequencer, the programmable drum machine, the MPC with pads you play, the Tenori-On... and all of those forces, styles, cultures, traditions converge in this object. And when you play this thing, you can feel all that tradition.

And yet that story extends back, what, 60 years or so at most? The feeling of "and still I can't read music" remains. Or maybe of "yeah, I don't need to read music! That's for those exclusive boring people!" or even this isn't a "real" instrument.



**Back to Shapes**

who exactly is that person who says "I want to learn music..." in 2023?

They're a person who might be concerned with playing a "real" instrument, but also maybe in producing? DJing? doing sound design? working with notational concepts programmatically? working with or designing audio detection algorithms? Working in an environment that's a blurry combination of all of these things, and of the echoes of everything that came before.

and you want to keep that orientation to the level of intuition.

and it also may not be relevant to explicitly foreground the traditional concept. that's a challenge, to be satisfyingly connected to it, but not for it to be the only means of access...



**a problem?** so there's a *condition* of tension between emerging and established, and this is a productive tension, a kind of energy source. but in the space where they become too far disconnected, where they're not working productively together, it does become a problem. "learning a concept" takes the place of playing intuitively. or playing intuitively can't make sense of the concepts.



**fluency space.** So being in that space, that perfect balance where they *do* work together, is another way of describing fluency. the experience of that space. the feeling it gives you. and so for Shapes, that feeling is the central focus.

So shapes does something interesting. You don't have "an experience of notation," as a whole, but you experience some aspect of it. And not a simplified, beginner version of it, but an aspect of the complex whole. 

So for example, when an experienced musician is playing their instrument, they're not thinking of the names of the individual notes. Or when they're reading, they may be working for the most part with something like a contour of notes within a context, rather than thinking of individual notes themselves. 

Shapes tries to hold these two things together&mdash;the feeling of the fluent musician, and the tradition of musical concepts, particularly as it's captured in the notational concepts that we consider most foundational, most important for a beginner, and design new points of connection.

So Shapes will allow for a much more radical flexibility in the concept. it's opening up different connection points in the tradition, but not departing from that tradition, because of the scope within which it considers its concepts. 

So the methodology allows, in essence, for modularizing the concepts. And then the presentation works with the modular concepts that result, rather than the aggregate concept in its traditional form. 

In other words, it draws out an aspect of the traditional concept, pulls it closer to intuition to create that productive space between intuition and concept, and then gradually begins to rebuild the traditional concept from there. 

You end up with the full-fledged standard notation system, or at least with the option for it. But your experience of it is totally different, because of the priorities you used to construct it. And you have some very different possible ways in to it, and ways to use it.



**How is it organized?** Shapes is organized as a series of (32) short levels, each of which focuses on creating an experience: they show you what to do rather than telling you why you're doing it.

The "why" comes across in the feeling you get. the mode of understanding is an experiential one. There are some short, optional "director's commentaries" interspersed throughout, also addressed directly to the learner, that explore some more theoretical questions that can come up around the levels.

You can see on this map that the levels wind their way through alternately focusing on musical symbols, instrumental skill, musical imagination (that is, something between intuition and inner hearing), and the overlaps between these focuses.

And the levels are further organized around a number of skills that you develop: playing by ear, developing tactile skill on an instrument, an experience of fluent reading, recognizing tensions, recognizing contexts, understanding the connection between tensions and contexts...

And so the experiences you have and the concepts you use are organized around this particular collection of skills. And the method kinda zippers them together into a very efficient progressive disclosure where they build on each other, complicate each other, build into each other, and leave you with a foundational yet very sophisticated set of skills for understanding&mdash;by experience&mdash;the depth and malleability of a musical concept.



### Demo 1: Playing

**L1 L2 experience.** 

this is where the method starts, the first experience of a learner, not with theoretical framing, but understanding through the experience. this is where to drop in that idea.

give a demo of single shapes, first the top shape, then the others. a hybrid level of one and many shapes. that you can play in any order, any combination, and importantly, using any fingers, even just one finger.

talk about the playlist, what it represents. and the experience of interacting it, how open-ended it is. how it's a matter of following your intuition, and adding something to the song that feels good to you.

then into the theoretical significance of this experience.

**no names**

Pythagoras hears a sound coming from the blacksmith's shop, so indeed he already has an intuition for that sound.

it is a relationship between two notes. Or, a few sets relationships.

the hammers allow him to measure the relationships. to ground them in something external, to produce a rational account for what he hears.

the notes themselves are not named. the relationships between them are.

the distinction of one shape, to many shapes.

one shape is grounding the intuition in a rational instrument.

most different, perhaps, is that it's doing it within an environment that's already full of instruments. that already has all the chromatic notes, all the names... it's a filter.

a filter back to a modern version of the experience of pythagoras (kind of, of course).

so there are maybe three things happening: 

- aha, a rational connection between this object and what I intuit!
- whew, a simplification to what matters.
- a pure way of interacting.

you have to think, before pythagoras had his hammers, what it would have felt like to try to deal with those sounds. he could sing them, i suppose, but with no way to account for what he was singing, other than by singing it.

you wonder if one of those sounds could even have a name? 

but then, if you could intuit them and sing them, you could also tune the strings of a lyre to them. by ear. that's different. then, like your voice, you have an object that represents the sounds, allows you to work with them, but without the rational account. 

so it wasn't an instrument pythagoras stumbled across, but a very particular kind of instrument--one that allowed him to make an account for the relationships. And for him, significantly, a numerical account.

where does that leave the lyre player? maybe you want to start by asking what the lyre player thinks (or could think) when they pluck a string. they're not thinking, "this relationship," or "this note," because notes, as expressions of relationships, didn't, couldn't exist. all they can think, really, is "this string." and i recognize the sound of this string, I know what sound it will produce.

so the notes were named, initially, by the strings you'd pluck to produce them. they had names like the lowest note, the forefinger note, the middle note.

so again, what's a shape doing? 

you approach this object, the keyboard, which really is the embodiment of a rational account par excellence, and you want to make it, really, feel like the lyre to the lyre player. this magical thing that you just know how to use. 

with no thought of what you're doing in a rational sense, because you can't. perhaps in an instrumental skill sense.

and then when pythagoras comes along and tells you about his discovery, what do you do? what does that change for you? but maybe first, what does the transition to multiple shapes do? and to a group of shapes?

i want to reiterate that i always felt this kind of delight at how far you could go in shapes without having names for the notes. why is that? why would it feel delightful that that wasn't necessary? it is indeed this feeling that you're working with something larger, pre-rational, with the potential for something rational. but before it.

and yet, weirdly, you know you're working in this environment, the keyboard, that is intensely rational. what's the feeling that produces? did the lyre player have that feeling, too, in a sense? knowing there's something to this, that i don't know, and maybe can't know, and maybe don't even need to know?

what would be the value of knowing?

would the other shapes exist if nobody knew? i mean, in our world, to connect to our intuition, we need more than one lyre. we need a little collection of lyres, and we can set one down and pick another up.

so why does the keyboard want to be a collection of lyres, rather than just one really big, really cool lyre?

because i'm arguing that the full keyboard isn't the connection to our intuition. god knows, it's probably not even our rational connection. it's some abstraction of our rational connection. and very likely that's why it's retained its shape in terms of the original lyre, rather than becoming a grid. looking at you, marlon.

haha mx. fagan said, like harmonicas. you don't play "the underlying structure of a harmonica," you play a damn harmonica!



so the questions here are:

- delight in not naming notes - "notes without names"
- the pre-rational experience, the lyre player
- but within a very rationally developed system. a return to intuition, the comfort of a system, but with only the suggestion of a system. the close focus on the connection of concepts and experience.



**centered keyboard**

here's the transition: so the keyboard is set up with these priorities-- to be this simple-feeling, playable collection of lyres, harmonicas, that also suggests a system.

and so there are some slight changes to its design principles. typically we think of keyboards as starting and ending on "C," and with white and black keys. Subtly, this embeds a lot of theoretical priorities. 

For one thing, there *is* a kind of "underlying structure of a harmonica" in the white keys, and the idea that the other keys are alterations or derivations of that underlying structure.

And also the idea that "C" is more important, prominent, because Major is more important, prominent, and C is the note that makes the white notes major.

But for Shapes the priorities are different. The keyboard is, on one hand, a diagram for organizing the shapes. Any shape, and not just the bottom keys, can represent this world of intuitions in a song. So it matters that some of the keys stick up and others don't, to give each shape its identity. but they're not different colors, because any shape can be its own group of "white keys."

And rather than seeing the keyboard as beginning and ending on "C," you see it as being symmetrical. because shapes are symmetrical, and that creates a mnemonic.

Then, it's also a playable instrument. And one you can navigate entirely tactilely, without looking at it. Our hands are also symmetrical. We have fingers that stick up like the keys that stick up. And when we align the contour of our hands with the contour of the keys, the keyboard becomes more than an efficient diagram... it becomes an efficient diagram that also matches our bodies.



**fingerings**

this gives us a principle for how our fingers match the keys. 

a lot of beginners feel a need to play scales, and there are really two separate impulses behind this. the first is theoretical, in a sense. to identify, distinguish the particular collections of notes that matter, and we've already made progress on this front through shapes. 

the other is to develop a feeling of physical connection to the instrument. the physical qualities of the keyboard that match our bodies creates a single fingering principle for playing through the shapes. 

demo in the TOP shape: you place your fingers that stick up on the keys that stick up, 3 on 3, then, 2 (peace signs) on 2, and your thumbs together in between. play these in order, and you have something that feels like a scale fingering. 

But it's more than a scale fingering: it's a principle for *any* scale fingering. you can start playing on any note of the shape, with the same fingering. 

and, beginning with this fingering, you can move into any other shape, and start on any other note.

This is a really tangible example, literally, of what results from a change in conceptual priorities, and from having more flexible concepts. If you've had music levels that see the keyboard as an extension of more traditional concepts, you would start by learning a "C" scale. You'd put your farthest left fingers on some Cs, and go from there, crossing your thumbs under at different times so that you'll also end with your farthest right fingers on Cs. 

Crossing the thumbs under at different times usually takes some getting used to, but you can do the same thing on D, or E...

But interestingly, when you get into keys that have some more topography, the priority of the starting note gives way to how the contour of your hands meets the contour of the keys. Because to have to cross your thumb up to a top key is just too physically awkward.

So carrying that principle throughout, you end up playing your D or E scale differently, but it's with the same fingering that you'd use to play any other scale, even a D scale starting on E. Because the focus is no longer on the particular scale, but it's zoomed out to the *shape*, to the contour of the keyboard, and to how your hands match that contour.

it's not about finding an easier way to play scales, but about making the idea of scales themselves more closely aligned with a musical intuition. They're a means of getting to know the shape, of showing your body how to meet the instrument. 

And so playing a scale is meaningless in itself&mdash;it disappears into a guideline that you begin to use intuitively as you play along with songs.



### Demo 2: Notation

[then into notation, which requires anchor.]

[The difference here, really, is the clef and accidentals.]

**mapping to the staff**

Now in the sequence of Shapes levels, this fingering principle is introduced in only one shape. And the way it expands to the other shapes is woven into a very particular experience of reading music notation.

To get into how Shapes approaches music notation, we have to go back to, well, the shapes. the little lyres or harmonicas that represent the collection of notes that intuitively fit with the music around us.

The lines and spaces of the musical staff represent the notes in a shape, the collection that feels like it fits with a song.

[notation with a shape and a staff]

But there's one thing missing. We need to know which note of the shape corresponds to which line or space on the staff! And so we introduce a little arrow clef: I'll choose "this" note of the shape, and I could choose to put it anywhere, but I'll choose to put it "here," on the middle line of the staff. 

So that note represents this position in the shape. And now (draw two more notes higher and play them), the lines and spaces of the staff correspond to the notes of the shape. Easy!



Now stepping out of the Shapes world for a sec, is this how standard notation works? Consider I did this same thing with the shape made up of all the bottom keys of the keyboard. And I choose "this" note (G), and I put it "here" (on the second line). So I have (draw 3 notes, play 3 notes).

I might ask myself, okay, isn't that the same as doing *this* in standard notation (draw a G clef a "G," and 2 more notes). This brings up some very significant questions, especially if I go back to my first shape and look at how *it* would be expressed in standard notation (draw Treble clef, six flats, "Ab").

The big question is: are the notes of the shape a part of the staff itself, or of the clef?

In the case of the shapes, the arrow clef was the means of connecting the shape context to the staff. So not only does it show the position that connects the shape and the staff, it also brings the context of the shape *to* the staff.

What's going on in the case of the standard treble clef is less clear. 

There are at least 3 possible scenarios:

- The context is also embedded in the clef, but that clef can only embed one possible context: no sharps and no flats.
- the context is part of the staff itself, the clef shows us a particular position in that context, and the key signatures modify it into other contexts.
- the context is embedded in the key signature, including the key signature of no sharps and no flats, and is applied to the staff. The clef represents a position common to all of those contexts, and the contexts are named in terms of the key signature of no sharps and no flats.



This takes us back to the distinction between playing with "the underlying structure of a harmonica" (or lyre), versus playing an actual harmonica or lyre.

The shape is focusing very directly on an experience that can result from any of these scenarios, which is that the notes mapped to the staff will represent the notes that intuitively feel like they fit with the song. And that's a good thing.

(and maybe mention incidentals here, that you can notate departures from the shape also without representing them in terms of no sharps no flats.)



**anchor & reading** 

And then Shapes takes this further by not using just any note for its clef, but using the *anchor* note, the note that feels like all the others are pulling toward it.

The anchor note is also a very intuitive experience, but a different one than hearing which notes fit. The anchor gets introduced much earlier, as a structuring principle for playing along with songs, but then it's reinforced as part of the environment within which we start reading.

So it goes something like this. You have a playlist of songs (L12 playlist) where an anchor note in a shape is mapped to the staff. 

And you little dots evenly spaced across the staff that represent the beat of the song. And then you put your fingers that stick up on the keys that stick up, and start by playing the anchor note along with the beat:

[play tactile 1 notation].

And then you move on to playing with all three fingers that stick up, and you start to really hear every time you return to the anchor note.

[play tactile 2 notation]

and then you add your thumbs...

[tactile 3 notation]

then you gradually expand into a fuller range of the shape, into *more* shapes, you open up to all anchors, and you map those anchors to different places on the staff. So it looks something like this:

[L23 playlist and notation]

and eventually the little dots that represent the beat get absorbed into the note symbols themselves, and you end up with something like this:

[same playlist, L27 notation]



Now all this is really fun, it feels like you're playing Guitar Hero, but it's actually a pretty amazing experience of the feeling of fluent reading that's a far cry from hitting the right buttons at the right time. It's an experience that actually **captures the feeling of being a fluent reader**. The notes don't have names, because you're reading their contours within a context. you're connected to the beat of the song, so the activity of reading is a way of listening that draws you more deeply into what you hear. You don't have to look at your hands, because you've learned to navigate the keyboard by touch.

And although you're reading which notes of the shape to play and when, you started by playing along on your own, so you're not by any means stuck to what's written, but you understand it as one potential, captured, among many other potential things you could play with the song.



the sequence:

- L4 shape fingering
- L12 TOP, 5L, 5R; 1, 2, & thumbs
- L18 add 4s. first thumbs, then expand to groups of 2
- L23 any anchor, and anchor moves in the notation.
- L27 add 3s and 2s. And rhythmic note values
- L30 add 1s and BOTTOM. And incidentals.





### Demo 3: Chord & Key

When notation is first introduced in Shapes, though, is earlier than all this. And it starts out as a way of illustrating something more structural about a song, something that grows out of the feeling of playing along in a shape.



we had the idea that the staff is mapped to the notes that fit. this part is really going to emphasize that. 



Okay, what matters here is the separation of the idea of shape and anchor. Because while the shape can only exist at one level, mapped to the staff, the anchor can exist at more than one: the "bass note" (chord) level, or the key level.

and so this means shapes are always at the chord level, even when they appear to be at the key level, because all the chord level changes keep the same shape.

and this is really at the theoretical heart of the method, why it's called shapes. why a shape needs to be separate from an anchor. and that the focus of where we connect via intuition is the unordered collection of notes at the chord level. Everything else builds out from that.



that's why take back the night is a good example: changing bass notes and shapes with a common key-level anchor. but maybe also clocks or roxanne that changes at the key level to make the distinction?





### Demo 4: Tonescapes

Now you can hear that a song fits with a shape. And you can hear that the notes are pulling toward the anchor. But when it gets into the idea that chord level anchors (bass notes) are tensions pulling toward a key level anchor, but also tension centers in themselves, that's pretty sophisticated.

And for that matter, hearing an anchor at all is a more refined, nuanced perception than hearing a shape. Not everybody agrees on what feels like the anchor. 

and so this brings us into by far the weirdest, most abstract, kinda coolest part of this method, that is, *tonescapes*.

A tonescape is a blob of sound that

- gives you a context for recognizing tensions
- gives you the sound of a context + tension (mood, which also relates to chords & keys...)
- builds your inner hearing: you listen inside.



There are 2 sequences together, that make up, geez, well over half the levels, really. What's the heart of the sequence?

- you've set these things up by playing. hearing contexts, hearing anchors, hearing notes in relation to anchors, and representing all those things on an instrument, and in notation. So this is moving all those things into the project of building an *internal* instrument, refining them much further, but more abstractly. A tonescape is an abstraction of a song in a shape.
- you start by recognizing tensions (L13 passive), and then you hear them *inside* the tonescape (L14 active plus simulation).
- the passive side expands progressively to recognizing all moods and all tensions, and the relationship of the tensions to the moods. Maybe this is where "light" and "heavy" are a better way to think of incidentals than "up" and "down" departures.
- the active sequence has you hear the notes you're learning to recognize, and uses notation. the L29 exercise gives you a sense of where this ends up. and then the method ends with free play imagery in any mood.



Wow there's a lot here. I didn't realize most of the method takes place in tonescapes. It makes it look like all the playing stuff is a way in to this pure "concept-by-experience" space. Which is really true. But that's what generalizes all of this to any instrument, not just the keyboard. A versatile, internal instrument that is the mechanism of fluency. of where you work with what you hear in a way that's both intuitive and rational, and create new concepts, and new instruments, while keeping them all connected to, i suppose, this sense of the deep tradition.

And that's a reasonable place to open up to questions. Yeesh.



thinking back to earlier, where are some spots (like in chord & key) that precursor concepts to tonescapes come up? moods and things.





### Closing
