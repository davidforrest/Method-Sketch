## Glossary



#### Mode

The standard term that, among many other things it implies, can be interchangeable with *[mood](#mood)*.

#### Mood

The feeling, or mood, that results from all the relationships of notes within a shape, when they are organized into tensions around one particular note of the shape.

#### Scale

A way of "measuring" a mode or musical structure, by collecting all of its notes, beginning on the first note, and plaing the notes in order. Does this mean you can play the "scale" of a chord structure? Where is the line between a scalar structure (like, say, a Blues Scale) and a chordal structure (like a cluster)? Where's the line between a scale and an arpeggio? Does an arpeggio require a triadic structure?

#### Stroke

A line drawn on the keyboard, within the grouping of five or seven keys that surround two or three top keys, connecting notes that make up a shape. Each shape is the combination of two strokes.

#### Tension

a feeling of pull (position) from the anchor independent of octave (highness or lowness). So while a tonescape has, what, 17 notes in it, it has 7 tensions.

#### Position

positions from the anchor, like 2nd, 3rd, 4th... also letter positions, C, D, E, more generally than considering light/heavy versions of these positions. so all positions are tensions, but not all tensions are positions.

#### Note

doesn't consider tension. it's just the note. but you can perceive it in terms of tension.

distinction between "notes" and "tensions" here? Is the anchor a tension, or a note?

- --> they are notes. and the relationship of other notes to the anchor are tensions. so you can have the feeling of tensions, but you recognize notes, and draw notes out of the tonescape.
