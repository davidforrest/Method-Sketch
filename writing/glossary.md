## Glossary



#### Mode

The standard term that, among many other things it implies, can be interchangeable with *[mood](#mood)*.

#### Mood

The feeling, or mood, that results from all the relationships of notes within a shape, when they are organized into tensions around one particular note of the shape.

#### Scale

A way of "measuring" a mode or musical structure, by collecting all of its notes, beginning on the first note, and plaing the notes in order. Does this mean you can play the "scale" of a chord structure? Where is the line between a scalar structure (like, say, a Blues Scale) and a chordal structure (like a cluster)? Where's the line between a scale and an arpeggio? Does an arpeggio require a triadic structure?

#### Stroke

A line drawn on the keyboard, within the grouping of five or seven keys that surround two or three top keys, connecting notes that make up a shape. Each shape is the combination of two strokes.
