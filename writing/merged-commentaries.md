## 1 - Why Music Videos?

Usually, when you start learning music, you begin by playing a simple song. You learn the notes one by one, you practice them in the same order until what you're playing begins to feel like music, and then you gradually build up to playing more and more difficult songs.

But with Shapes, you don't start by playing a song. Instead, you start by playing *along with* songs.

And not just with one song, but with *lots* of songs. An endless playlist of songs.

And not just with songs, but with songs that have music videos.



it's a feeling of something infinite, continuous. something that you don't build up to, but something that you're already wholly a part of.

you're dropped into a world that's saturated with meaning. and the more current the song, the closer to now, the more inseparable it is from the world that created it.

you experience this kind of meaning when, for example, the sound of one of the instruments in a song reminds you of other songs you know. Or when the clothes the dancers are wearing in a music video evoke a style... every little detail in a current song has the potential for infinite meaning

a shape gives you a way to begin interacting with something infinite. and that interaction is emphasizing certain aspects of music, without excluding all the others.

it's not the only way, by any means. but it's a way that generalizes between songs. it deals with notes. notes you can sing or play. and while fashion or the sound of an instrument may be more particular to a certain song or style, the domain of singable, playable notes has a place in every style

and because it's so general, it's something you're already very familiar with. if you've ever heard a wrong note...

so shapes is starting at that level, the level of what you know intuitively. it's not attempting to build up from smaller pieces, but to start with the biggest thing, the intuitive experience, and find its way to the particulars, the details.







What's the deal?



i'm trying to work with pitches, but to make that activity about more than pitches.

so we're starting with something infinite and precategorical, especially because it's now. 

- (now means more saturated with meaning than ever before or ever again--and also a certain kind of meaning, not accrued historical, intellectual meaning, but an immediate, intuited, affective meaning)

then making a case for how the pitch domain gives us a way into being rational about that infinite thing.

which will relate in the next commentary to this even more general idea of pitch context--of shape (which does this same thing not only with songs, but with other theoretical concepts...)

and how that is a way of stepping into a world and listening to it, experiencing it, observing it, observing what infinite factors are pulling on and affecting the fixed concept we're paying attention to.

that's the point. that if we can find something common, then that common thing will highlight what's particular about each song, and help us to notice it. 

that's what a theoretical concept is. and when it stops being common, if it stops working, it's time to rethink it.



#### outline?

- learning a song, vs playing with a song. what's different about the experience?
- music around us = basis for our contexts, intuitions (focus rather than structures)
  - evaluating the tradition always in terms of now.
- current music = infinite associations
- accessing that through pitch
  - not limiting to the pitch domain, but listening through it. 
- playing as listening.








#### Scraping Current Music

I scrape music charts every week, I've been doing that for years and years. Some of those sources are more mainstream like Billboard, YouTube, or Spotify charts, others tend more toward a particular style, like Complex, The Fader, and Popjustice, and others are a little more curated, or more indie, like Pitchfork, The New York Times Playlist, and Stereogum.

And all together, regardless of their innumerable styles, genres, levels of popularity, this all fits together into a broad category of "current music." 



They're not of a particular style, just things that have percolated to the top of popular culture by one means or another, either commercially, or because of music critics, lists, so anything that's ever been on Billboard, Pitchfork, HypeMachine, the NYT Playlist and several others shows up here. So the idea is "music in the air."

That's the significance of Justin Bieber to the Western Canon.

So if a song comes up and you don't like it, you can skip it.



the other steps that lead the playlist to be curated?



#### The Music Around Us

One way in which this playlist has a possible significance for [any particular song we might pay attention to] is that it's just music that's in the world around us, in the air, in our experience, it's just the stuff we hear in our lives, and so it's had some kind of effect on us in some way. So it doesn't hurt to consider this as something we're dealing with.



(it draws from the largest environment--our lives. 

or, song/playlist : our lives :: shape/concept/environment : song)



What this is meant to represent is the music in the air around us in the world. It's not a particular style, it's just stuff that's somehow managed to percolate to the top of popular culture in some way. Some of it is kinda offensive, some is not... you can skip over it.



* **Why is this significant? It represents, largely something about how you listen to all music. The context through which you're hearing anything. Even if you listen to classical music or whatnot. 

You can hum along with it. 



#### Infinite Domains

One thing interesting about starting with a current song, and moreso a music video, is that there's an infinite amount of stuff in there that we can focus on.

Production stuff (noticed autotune), social cues, timbres of instruments, references to styles, lyrics that mean something to us... there's so much in a song, in music. And instead of dealing with this infinite, open thing, we're filtering our rational account of this thing to the domain of pitch, to something we can sing. And that's something that's happened in the tradition of thinking about music for as long as we have any record.

Autotune wasn't the thing that people grabbed onto in Ancient Greece... because obviously nobody was using autotune yet. But maybe the very particular nuances of the sounds of the strings of the lyre, or the aulos could have been what they focused on--the sound of instruments and how they differ. But they didn't. It was pitch.

And why? Pitch generalizes.



There are infinite domains of things that we could be paying attention to. Music might be about some kind of emotional inflection, about sunset in the music video, or the particular sound of an instrument and how that makes you feel.

But we're focusing instead on this domain of pitch that would generalize from one song



#### Pitch Generalized

** in order to play *with* a song:

we were catching on to specific notes in the song, but also doing something way weirder than that--to abstract some collection of notes that don't necessarily occur in the song at that moment and sing them. And we did that, but we'd also latch on to sounds we *did* hear, and move away from them. 

So there's a generalized concept of notes that fit together, that work, and that collection of note would float up out of that particular song, and also out of a lot of other songs, which would give us a way to relate all those songs to each other. Which is a pretty fair reason to have a theoretical concept.

And also something we can use to learn, to get us singing/playing, to get something musical happening.



#### intuition

this also makes the interesting point that these sorts of contexts, these worlds of notes are in our ears already, so we're coming to any music we listen to with expectations, established patterns, and a lot of intuitions that in many ways come from our musical surroundings, from what we've grown up with.

and those are patterns that persist (in certain ways) through all music of all people of all time.


 The take away is that we're not coming into this with no intuitions about music, we're not starting from scratch, we're not learning the basics that we're then building music up from. We're starting with an infinite lot of stuff, and we're trying to build up from that, give an account of it, and make it into concepts that we can think about, work with, and then feed back into that loop of our intuitions. 

Playing (or singing) along shows you that you know a lot of stuff about music already. You're not coming to this experience from scratch, and you're also not building it up from basics. You're starting top down.



#### Playing as a way of Listening

Related to stepping inside the world of a concept. **This is a way that playing with the pitch collection domain can absorb all the infinite other domains, by placing you in the song and allowing you to notice them.**

Also maybe mention here that the instrument is chosen, leveled, etc., in order to focus on this experience. But those choices are other directions this experience can take you, other kinds of listening, other sensitivities to other domains.






## 2 - What Is a Shape?



#### Standard Musical Ideas

People who already have some experience studying music often ask, "isn't the shape just a scale?" Or maybe it's the song's key? Or maybe a mode? 

These are all ways of asking: how can we relate Shapes to standard musical ideas? How can we connect this experience with the terms we've already learned, and that other musicians will understand?

To begin making this connection, it helps to think of a shape as a way of zooming out to a broad idea that has the potential to become any, or all, or none, of these more familiar ideas. As a vantage point from which we can see and experience familiar musical concepts a little differently.

The standard idea most closely related to a shape, perhaps, is a key signature. What a key signature does is to say, okay, the musical staff is mapped to the key of "no sharps and no flats" (or all the white notes of the piano), but I'm going to modify these notes so they contain, for example, a "B-flat" instead of a "B," and the collection of notes will now more closely match the music I'm describing.

The notes of a key signature will give you one of the shapes. So the first shape you played with would be the key signature of six flats (or six sharps). 

<img src="../media/top_shape.png" alt="Image" align="center" style="width: 12%;">

But this isn't quite how a shape works, because the shape doesn't reference the key signature of "no sharps and no flats." Instead, each shape gets to be its own starting point, its own key signature of no sharps and no flats. And there's something very different in the way of thinking when the basis for your collection of notes isn't the white notes of the piano that are then modified, but rather, it's just *this collection of notes*&mdash;the shape. 

This means you can take any note of the shape, say the middle note in the bottom group, and you could decide to play one note higher, to modify it, a note "up" from that note. 

<img src="../media/top_shape_L.png" alt="Image" align="center" style="width: 12%;">

Thinking in standard terms, you would begin with an A**♭** or G**♯** that's part of the key signature, then modify that note "up" to, effectively, an A**♭**-sharp, or G**♯**-sharp, which you would then call "A-natural," or "G-double sharp"&mdash;a modified version of a note that's *already* modified from the white notes of the piano.

So when you're thinking in terms of key signature, you're referencing a theoretical collection of notes&mdash;the key of no sharps and no flats&mdash;that doesn't necessarily describe the sound and experience of the music you're playing with. That theoretical collection matters, because it describes the relationships between notes that are common to all the key signatures. But a shape lets you step back and work with these relationships more broadly, without having to reference all of them in terms of any particular one of them.



#### A Scale or Mode?

Now, if you choose one of the notes in the shape, say the first top key in the bottom group, and play all the notes of the shape in order starting from that note, you'll get a scale.

<img src="../media/top_shape_V.png" alt="Image" align="center" style="width: 12%;">

And starting from this particular note, you get a *Major* scale, which is also a way of expressing the Major mode. Or you could choose to start from any other note of the shape, and you'd get a different scale and mode: the minor, dorian, or Lydian, and so forth.

But a shape doesn't tell you which note to start or end on. And it also doesn't tell you in which order to play the notes. It's just a collection of notes that you can play in *any* order or combination. So while a shape has all the ingredients to become a scale or a mode, it *isn't* one, yet, until you&mdash;or a song you're playing with&mdash;turns it into one.

In fact, as you're playing, you'll come across different songs that fit with different scales or modes, but that are all still in the same shape. Or individual songs that change midway from one scale or mode to another, but that nonetheless remain in the same shape. This means that scales can change, modes can change, chords can change, and in some cases, even key signatures can change (to their enharmonic equivalents), and yet you can still remain in the same shape. 

And really, one purpose of a shape is to let you zoom out and think in terms of something broader than any of these concepts. You're taking all the notes that fit with the song on one hand, and the note they're organized around on the other, and allowing them to remain separate. So you can focus on just the broad grouping of notes that fits with the song throughout. 

Then your intuitions about what sounds good can begin to take over and fill in the details. You begin to do less thinking, and more experimenting, more interacting with what's happening in the song. You begin to focus more on the sound, experience, and feeling of playing, rather than on the specific concepts that may describe the song, like scales or modes.



#### The Song's Key?

When a musician asks, "what key is this song in?" they usually mean two separate things: first, what's the overall collection of notes that fits with the song&mdash;the key signature&mdash;and second, what's the note that all the other notes are pulling toward&mdash; the *key note*, tonal center, or tonic.

By this way of thinking, the idea of key is very closely related to mode. Key is like a mode that's applied to the whole song, at the most general level, so that it describes the sound of the song overall. And as with mode, a shape lets you begin by separating these two aspects of key from one another, and to play, at first, with just the collection of notes that fit with the song.

Because to hear that a shape fits with a song is a very different perception, way of listening, than to hear which particular note is the tonal center. Most people can hear this fit very easily, intuitively, for the same reasons that you can have the experience of hearing when a musician plays a "wrong" note during a performance, even if you have no musical training whatsoever. But to have a feeling for the tonal center requires a much more specific kind of listening, and different people will have this experience more or less intuitively at first. Yet both of these experiences&mdash;the collection of notes and the note they're pulling toward&mdash;are aspects of the song's key. So one way to think of a shape is as half of a key, and before it becomes a key.

Stepping into slightly more theoretical territory, it also helps to make a distinction between "Major" and "Minor" as they are often used to describe keys in functional tonality, and the Major and minor modes themselves. Many of the songs you'll come across fit with a shape and tonal center that give you a different mode than the Major or minor modes. This is because any note in the shape has the potential to be the tonal center in a song, and the Major and minor modes are only two of seven possibilities.

In functional tonality, which has a strong influence on many of our standard musical ideas, key is most often described as being either Major or Minor. But this means these terms have been abstracted from the modes themselves, and are instead describing more general *categories* of modes: the Lydian, Major, and Mixolydian (or Dominant) modes would all be absorbed into the "Major" category, and the dorian, minor, phrygian, and locrian modes would be absorbed into the "Minor" category. These categories aren't a result of thinking in terms of modes, but of thinking in terms of triadic chord structures, and in particular, of the quality of the *third* in the chord, as being Major or Minor. A key, then, becomes a broad category within which each chord has a function. These broad categories can be described by scales, or modes, but it is the Major and minor modes in particular that contain the notes most significant to tonal *function*, and so in functional tonality, all the other modes become modifications of these two, paradigmatic modes. 

Now, if all this about function made no sense whatsoever, don't worry, you're hardly alone. The point, perhaps, is that thinking of keys as being strictly Major or Minor will leave you with a whole lot of songs that don't quite fit with the shape you're using to describe them. If you've ever heard a DJ set on the radio, or at a party, where the DJ mixes one song into another, and the beat matches, but the notes of the two songs don't quite match, you've had an experience of this very problem. Most DJ software is programmed to detect only Major and Minor keys, and (assuming the detection algorithm works correctly), all the different modes will be grouped together under only these two categories, so that, say, a song in the phrygian mode and a song in the dorian mode will both be described as "Minor," and will be mixed together, and everyone will stop dancing to inwardly cringe for a moment.

But if you allow yourself to think, as we did at first, of *key* as being a mode that's applied to the whole song, you won't run into any of these sorts of problems. And moreover, you'll always stay grounded in the intuitive experience of the notes that fit&mdash;the shape, and the note they're pulling toward&mdash;the tonal center. This will be the basis from which you can also begin to understand musical ideas that are slightly abstracted from this more concrete experience&mdash;ideas like the Major and Minor keys in functional tonality.



#### The Song's Chords?

So, one note of the shape can become the tonal center of a song, and the combination of the shape and tonal center will describe the song's key overall. But more locally, one note of the shape can also become the *root note* of a chord, and the combination of the shape and root note will also fully describe that chord.

If you begin from the root note and skip every other note of the shape, you'll get a chord, and in particular, a *triad*. And if you continue skipping every other note until you return to the root note an octave higher, you will have played all the notes of the shape, and you will have extended your triad all the way up to a 13th chord.

Perhaps a little less traditionally, if you play *any* combination of the notes in the shape, organized in relation to the root note, you will have also played a chord, although not necessarily a triadic chord. 

And even less traditionally, you could play just a single note, and that note can organize all the other notes of the shape that are already implied in the song more broadly, into a change at the chord level, and thus, into a chord.

In all of these cases, the shape is a way of describing the song's chords. If chord roots change within a single shape, that same shape will describe multiple different chords. And further, if the whole song is also in the same shape, then the shape will describe both an aspect of the song's key, *and* of its changing chords, at the same time. It's a single idea that gives you a way into these different theoretical layers and musical aspects of the song, all at once.



#### A Shape as an Idea

What, then, would it mean to think of a shape as a musical idea in its own right, rather than thinking in terms of standard concepts? What are a shape's qualities, and what does it allow you to do?

On one hand, a shape uses an instrument&mdash;the keyboard&mdash;as a diagram. So there's no separation between the concept you're using to think about music, and your means of making music. 

Moreover, that diagram is a mnemonic device, a very efficient way to help you remember complex ideas quickly. If you've ever tried a keyboard tutorial that lights up the notes you're supposed to play, or that scrolls the notes like Guitar Hero does, you've had an experience that forces you to think purely in terms of individual notes, from one note to the next. It's a little like playing a game of whack-a-mole. And this is often how reading music, or learning a song, feels to a beginner. 

But rather than lighting up the individual notes on the keyboard, a shape represents a broader collection of notes by connecting them with a stroke. It allows you to grasp the whole idea at once, as a single symbol, a gesture, without having to think about each of the parts that make it up. So in addition to representing ideas directly on an instrument, and in a way that's easy to remember, the shape also emphasizes musical contexts over specific musical structures, like melodies or chord voicings. It shifts the focus from which notes to play, to which notes are *possible* to play. And this means that you become a part of the concept as well, since what it represents is the place where your intuitions meet a particular moment of music.

So is the shape an idea that's specific to the keyboard, or does it apply to other instruments as well? 

Guitarists often think in terms of shapes, too. But these tend to describe the shapes that particular chord structures or scales make on the fretboard, that you can then move around to different positions. So while guitar shapes are also a way of using the instrument as a diagram, they tend to focus on specific musical structures more than on contexts.

Of course, nothing prevents a guitarist from understanding a scale shape as a broader collection of notes that doesn't necessarily start or end on any particular note, or from understanding chord shapes as particular expressions of that collection at a more local level of the song. These are the very same distinctions that we've already made between a shape and a scale, mode, or chord. It's the difference between thinking of the shape of some particular musical structure, versus as an idea that filters the entire fretboard into a collection of notes that will fit with the song. 

The physical layout of a shape is different on the guitar, too, because while the fretboard itself is structurally similar to the keyboard&mdash;in that both divide a continuous pitch spectrum into the same sequence of relationships between individual notes&mdash;you access those relationships through several strings that are each tuned differently. So the guitar is like several keyboards side-by-side, and staggered according to how the strings are tuned. This means the guitar has its own set of diagrammatic constraints and affordances that are different from those of the keyboard.

The keyboard emphasizes the relationships of the diatonic order&mdash;the key of no sharps and no flats&mdash;in a way that the guitar doesn't, through its layout of bottom, "white" keys and top, "black" keys. The position of the two semitones within the diatonic order has the effect of suggesting two distinct groupings of keys on the keyboard, one with two top and three bottom keys, and the other with three top and four bottom keys. These groupings repeat in a symmetrical pattern across the keyboard, and they offer a simple, convenient unit for diagramming a shape. 

<img src="../media/groups_symm.png" alt="Image" align="center" style="width: 60%;">

But they also organize the overall sequence of notes on the keyboard according to the relationships of the diatonic order. This leads to a diagrammatic inconsistency based on the constraints, or the priorities, of the instrument, similar to the inconsistencies in how guitar shapes move across different strings.

So there are instrumental and diagrammatic aspects of a shape that are closely linked. And this relationship allows the instrument itself to become a musical symbol, a means of representing musical ideas. But then, the shape also represents a broad collection of notes that fit with a song, and while you can access this collection in different ways on different instruments, it is an idea that's not specific to any particular instrument, or even, necessarily, to instruments at all.



#### So, What *is* a Shape?

The mnemonic, instrumental, and conceptual aspects of a shape, paired with a song, all set the stage for a musical experience that's very intuitive. This experience relies less on any standard musical ideas you've learned, and more on your sense of what sounds good with the song, or adds something new to the song. It draws on all of the experience you've gathered by being surrounded by music throughout your life.

And so it's not that absolutely anything in the shape will sound good with the song&mdash;but more that anything *you* play is very likely to sound good. The shape gives you just enough to allow your intuitions to take over. 

So in one sense, a shape is a way of stepping back from the ideas you'd usually encounter at first, like learning how to construct a scale so that you can improvise with it. But you can also think of a shape as what happens *after* you've learned all those kinds of ideas, when you've internalized them and don't have to think about them anymore.

Because if you're an experienced musician, and you're improvising, the experience is very much like playing with a shape. You're no longer thinking "this is a G," or "that's a Major scale" and so on, although you could certainly turn on that layer of thinking if you wanted to. Instead, you're in a musical context, you're reacting to the music, and you're using your intuitions and your instrument to move through the music in a way that sounds good to you. It's only once you're in the midst of this kind of experience that you might start to ask questions like, okay, how can I understand what I just did? And how might I incorporate that understanding into what I do next?

So even without having ever played an instrument before, a shape lets you jump into something of what it feels like to be an experienced musician&mdash;to have that extraordinary feeling right from the beginning. And this feeling and experience becomes the basis for your learning. It's a place that generates potential, not only for what you might play, but also for what concepts you might draw on, whether these concepts are standard or nonstandard, clearly articulated or not yet disentangled from one another. 

In this way, a shape is not meant to be an alternative to standard musical ideas, or to the theoretical tradition it grew out of. It doesn't say, as many alternative methods do, "music learning is hard, so we've gotten rid of all that hard stuff and are starting with something totally different." Quite the opposite, a shape is meant to give you a way *into* the tradition, but a very particular way. A shape sets you up to think of any musical idea you encounter as a little instrument, or a little world that you can step into and play around in. An instrument or world that gives you some possibilities, some constraints, and that helps you notice something particular about music. This is a creative way to think of any musical idea&mdash;to ask, okay, what can I do with this? How can I place myself inside of this idea, and what does it afford me? And beginning with a shape, you start to build a kind of toolset of musical ideas. You won't rely on these tools entirely, but you might draw on some of them, sometimes, for different purposes, if and when they become relevant. Or sometimes you might decide not to think in any of these terms at all, and to just play with the shape.

As a way into learning music, a shape aims to start with the broadest and blurriest idea possible&mdash;your intuitions&mdash;and to gradually focus that idea into more refined, specific ideas. Beginner learning often works the other way around&mdash;by starting with the smallest ideas and building upward toward intuition. There's often a promise implied in beginner music lessons: if you do this very repetitive, rote thing, and you do it for long enough, it will eventually fall away, or become something else, and you won't need it anymore. And the learner says, okay, I kind of trust you, and then more often than not stops taking lessons before the rote activities ever transform into something that feels like intuition.

When it *does* make that transformation, however, the result is already very refined&mdash;an intuition that includes a great deal of technical experience. This is a very effective, and ultimately satisfying approach to learning music, but most people don't stick around for long enough to experience its benefits. And besides that, building up from smaller, more specific ideas can give the impression that music is made up of those ideas, rather than that it is something that generates ideas, or is perhaps even entirely outside the realm of ideas.

When you begin by playing with a song, moving between the notes of the shape, and following your ear, you're already playing in this intuitive way. You're not thinking, "now I'm going to play a G, now I'm going to play an A-flat, where's the A-flat on the keyboard? Oh, it's in the middle of the three top keys..." Rather, you play a note, and maybe have a feeling for which direction you should go next, or you may jump to some other note and listen to what it sounds like, then have a sense of whether the next note should be higher or lower, and so on. 

So you're already working in this more intuitive way, following contours of the melody, and of your instrument, responding to the sound of the song. There's no transition where you stop thinking in terms of individual notes, or scales, or so on, and start doing something more intuitive. Your intuition is what frames the ideas from the beginning&mdash;even what *creates* them. The shape is a means of setting into motion a process of playing and of learning where every experience and every idea are connected in this way, and so it's also very efficient, and inexhaustible.

## 4 - The Centered Keyboard



#### physical / concepts?

is it different to have an experience with your body, than to think of a gesture in your mind?

The shape is a diagram, so it's an intellectual concept, something you can have in your imagination, and that you can use as a way of abstracting it away from the keyboard and applying it to something like a key signature, or to your voice.

It's also a picture of an instrument that you can play, and that instrument is literally shaped like your hands, with keys that stick up like your fingers stick up. So it's physical. And the physical aspect of it is also diagrammatic. 

So you can have a concept that instantiates as a physical concept on this instrument, that you can also abstract away, and at the same time, you're interacting with music. Maybe not a music video, maybe your'e playing with someone, with a recording,

So there's yet another thing going on, which is that you're hearing these contexts and interacting with them in a perceptual way, that isn't necessarily physical on an instrument or purely conceptual, separately from an experience.

So you ahve all of those things going on: physical, perceptual, intellectual, instrumental... and in a perfect world, they all work together. And when you're building the physical skill, it's also reinforcing the skill that will help you abstract it from the instrument and apply it somewhere else.

So in this way, does your thinking become an instrument?

Say you play with a shape on the keyboard, and then you hear something and you're able to have an account for it, and you're able to sing it, and bring it inside your own body, and then you're able to imagine it *without* singing it, you've instrumentalized yourself. You've actually turned your own musical imagination into an instruemnt, that's also relying on concepts that are instruements.

In any of these cases, you're taking something that feels intuitive, bouncing off of an external, rational thing, whether it's physical or conceptual or whatnot, then bringing it back inside of yourself. And then you have this structured thing that you can work with. 

[cont'd FR music]: If you imagine trying to construct the notes in ratios on a monochord, but with just your voice, you can't do it. There's no way to know, you need to have some kind of external, physical thing to reflect yourself off of, like a monochord, or you need to happen by a blacksmith's shop, or something like that. 

And then, once you've done that, you ahve a rational account for it that you can bring back into your body, and then you can produce the sound of this ratio with your voice. But before you've done that, you can't. 

So that's maybe a very base-level way of imagining what that process is like, and what the relationship of the external concept, and the account, and your experience, and the musical output and input, etc. is.   





## 5 - What is the Anchor?



####  why does the anchor sound like the anchor?

in some way or another, in the song, the [tonal center] is being emphasized. Possibly in the bass, possibly in the melody, it's probably landing in time on a regular repetition of pulses/beats, in some way that your attention is drawn to it. 

And that can also happen by omitting it when you expect it. If you have notes dancing around it, and where it *should* land, it's not there, that will also emphasize the note.

So if the notes weren't moving in time, there wouldn't be anything that emphasizes the tonal center. And if it were just static, but you had the tonal center as the lowest note, or the highest note, or the loudest note, it would likely draw your attention to that note so that you hear it as the tonal center.

So there's that, and there's also a sense of expectation from stylistic conventions, from what you know from other music you've listened to. For example, there are some songs where the tonal center is ambiguous. . 

But that information is filled in by expectations around other songs in the style. And sometimes, different people will disagree on what the tonal center. 

And tha'ts pretty cool, because then you ahve an excuse to get deeper in to this phenomenon, to train yourself to hear it in more detail. Because if you get to know the particular sound of the second note from the anchor, or the third note, then when you hear a note that sounds like that particular tension, you will know where the tonal center *would* be.

This happens all the time, you'll listen to any particular note in a piece, and it sounds like, say, a fifth away from the tonal center. And when you hear that, you know where the tonal center is, and it might not be where you expected it to be. 

And then you can start to ask very interesting questions--why does it sound like this when, intellectually, my idea of what the key is, or what I'm seeing in the notation tells me something different. And that's the kind of moment where you can really get into some of the most exciting questions of what's going on in a piece of music. 



####  what is the anchor?

[gotye (or any dorian) example: hum the tonic, what note is that (E), and what key signature?] but it's supposed to be "in F" (the major key, or maybe the minor key?) 
but F doesn't sound like the tonal center.

So key signature is something that's bigger than key, as in "key note." So if you take the key signature of "one flat," which this song is in, and you have a song where the tonal center is a "B," then the key signature of one flat gets magnitized to B, and colored to B, and it's B minor. but if the song pulled you to F instead, then it would be F major. And both would be the "key of one flat."

But it will happen in songs that any of the seven notes in the shape can and will be the tonal center. It won't just be strictly major and minor. You'll find a lot of rap/trap tracks where A will be the tonal center here. 

So again this is separating the idea of key into two ideas, two different aspects. Separating the idea of notes that fit together, from the idea of a note they're pulling toward.

And you hear these differently, they're different perceptions, too.



#### key as major or minor (also see wk6)

So we think of key as being always major or minor. It's kind of a binary. You don't ever hear of a "phrygian" key. So if you have this phrygian key song, it would be called "minor". 

A practical example where this gets weird is DJ software that matches songs so that you can do harmonic mixing. Usually also thinks in major/minor, so you'll get a phrygian song tagged as minor, so that when it mixes with another song that's actually the minor mode, it sounds messy. You hear this on the radio a lot, when two songs in a DJ set just don't feel right, in terms of their notes, when they're transitioning from one to the other.

So that's an artifact of major an dminor being higher level descriptors of "lightness" and "heaviness", or "brightness" and "darkness", that describe several possible modes, such that minor and phrygian, and dorian, can all be versions of "Big Minor," and Lydian and Major and Dorian can all be versions of "Big Major".

There's a difference between the major and minor modes, and major as an idea that describes general majorness.



####  natural, harmonic, melodic minor

This is talking about "natural" minor.

With harmonic minor, if you're thinking in this way of context plus tonal center, with harmonic minor, on the seventh note, you move into a different context entirely, and then back when you return to the tonic. You move into the "Dominant" context, and you hear that note as being a third in the Dominant context, and then you come back to hearing minor.

Then melodic minor started to show up with this same progression to Dominant, but from minor. And then you can have modes from melodic minor as well, and they have a different sound.

[example of Alt resolving to dorian, a familiar sound, and Alt is a melodic minor mode]

And that would be a "D augmenteddominant seventh, flat and sharp 9, sharp 11, and maybe flat 13th..." so it starts to break the triadic way of thinking of chords.

so it makes more sense to think of that kind of thing as modal? there's no right way to think of a musical concept. But there are choices. If you think of this as a functionally dominant, then there are a lot of modifications going on. If it's a dominant chord, how can it have an augmented fifth? But it does, or maybe that's the flat 13th? And then it has a flat 9th and a sharp 9th, but the sharp 9th is also a minor third. But it has a major third, because it's Dominant...

It doesn't make sense intellectually in that way. But there's recourse to the idea that there's a collection of notes that fit together, that are pulling toward one note. and tha'ts intuitive. which creates a mode, and this sound, however we voice it, is an expression of the sound of that mode.

So at any moment in music you're listening to, if you freeze the music and say i want to round up, or hum, or play on the piano the seven-ish notes that feel like they fit in this world, and then to find the one note they're magatized toward, those two ideas will give you all the information that would be contained in all of those other symbol systems. 

And with that information, and with that intuition, you can start to make choices about how to name what you hear in those other systems. But you also don't *have* to name them. 

Part of what's cool about playing instruments and using a mnemonic device, is you don't have to think in terms of "what note is this."

And when you're a really fluent reader or improviser, you *dont'* think of what note this is. You're just playing contours inside of a context, following your ear, listening to other people. So you play "that note, that note, that note," and i'm not thinking "that's a D-flat, or in this case a C-sharp," instead, I'm thinking, that button comes after that one, it's making a gesture on the instrument and you're playing and thinking in that way

So if you were a really fluent musician who has learned all this stuff, and internalized it, and forgotten it, you actually are thinking in very much the same way that someone who's never learned any of it, and is just messing around with music videos is thinking about it. So you have a real insight, just as a beginner at keyboard, to feel what it's like to be a really, really experienced keyboard player.



#### jazz? (and layers of tonal context)

Isn't this what a jazz musician does? listens for the tonal center, plays lots of accidentals... that is, what the hell is a jazz musician doing?

We don't need to make a distinction between jazz and otherwise. because a jazz musician is thinking both in terms of the shape and anchor of the whole piece, but also of the changing chords.

So you can get into the world of each changing chord, and those are almost like different key signatures that are changing.

So you can have two situations: a world in which you're playing the same shape, and you give it an anchor note, and you change the anchor note, and these are all different chords. Each with its own anchor, but all those anchors in turn pulling to the anchor of the piece overall.

Or you can have a situation where with new chord, you also change the shape, even if the anchor stays the same. So both the anchor and shape can change, both at the chord level and at the key level. 

So you're pulling toward the tonal center of the whole piece, but you have this other layer of tonal centers, that are like your chord roots. That are pulling toward the tonal center of the piece, but each of *them* is its own little world, where all the notes are pulling toward the root note of the chord, and *then* pulling toward the tonal center of the piece.

And you'll hear these things happening at the same time. You'll hear a note that's infused with "thirdness" *and* "fifthess". It's the third of a chord, but also a fifth relative to the piece overall. And this is a really immediate feeling you can have that gives you picture of the piece you're in, of what's happened before, and perhaps of what you can expect.

These kinds of changes apply just as well to a pop song, or to any music with respect to tonal context, as they do in jazz. These are different ways of stylizing the same ideas, or perhaps, these ideas are generalizations that can apply to any of these musical styles.



####  the name "anchor" and making up names

"Anchor" is not the traditional name for this idea. It's often called "tonal center" or "tonic," or sometimes "key note," or in some cases "root."

In a way, I like being able to make up words in music theory, because this allows you to consider an idea separately from all the associations it may already have.

If i say "anchor," I can make that mean i want to *intentionally* position myself at this note, I want to make myself hear that this note is the note the others are pulling towrad. And if i were to choose to make myself hear a different note, I can do that with some training.

(an example? we did this with Hodie)

That I actively change my perspective and hear a piece in a totally different way tonally just because i've oriented myself to a different  tonal center. It's really cool.



####  function?

So now that we have an anchor, or tonal center, each of the other notes feels like it's pulling toward that tonal center. You really hear this (in Lesson 4?) when you alternate notes with the tonal center.

So there are two things we can do with that. One, we can hear it and use it to structure things we play...



####  modal realm vs functional?

i really have to think more about this, because i'm noticing people around me make a stronger distinction between modal thinking and otherwise, and i don't. So i may have to be more explicit about that. perhaps in the modes extra writing.

and it can get even weirder and say that this could apply not only to key, but also to chord. And that chord as a concept is also potentially a combination of the notes that feel like they fit together, and the note they're pulling toward.

a chord symbol (Em) might mean play the specific notes E, G, B, or it might mean that it's the mode minor, and the chord that would happen if you skipped every other note of that chord. Or, if you play any notes of that mode, as a chord structure.



####  matching a shape / abstract songs / ambiguity

So there's that, and there's also a sense of expectation from stylistic conventions, from what you know from other music you've listened to. For example, there are some songs where the tonal center, or even the shape, is ambiguous. There just aren't enough notes in the song, enough information, to tell you *exactly* what's going on. 

But that information is filled in by expectations around other songs in the style. 





## 6 - Musical Structures



- imagined structures, pre-notation, focused by the anchor.
- in a strange way, it's a precursor to the structured "anchor-higher-lower" entry into a tonescape, and the way that moves into structured movement around a tonescape, and then gradually less structured movement--or rather, that the structuring becomes gradually more internalized.
- So there's a sort of opposition being set up here, on one hand, a sort of rational structuring, and on the other, an imaginitive unstructuring.
- originally, this included trying to figure out the melody. but that seems like a very different activity: figuring out a particular structure, versus focusing on the principles behind a particular structure that results.
- people will start to bring their ideas (like chords) onto this lesson.
- it also sounds more structured. which raises the question of how much of the structure comes from the concept.
- the sense of play is aided by structure.
- this also suggests some other ways to read the regions of overlap on the map. "Instruments-Imagination" can mean, as it does here at first, instruments to aid the imagination, but later, it can also become the imagination as itself an instrument. 
- also, overlaps are spatially opposite to the center of a region--can you say, for example, that the overlap of Symbols and Instruments is somehow polar to the land of Imagination proper?





## 7 - Key and Chord Levels



"bass notes" are chord level anchors

- Shapes is always at the chord level. If you're not at the chord level, you're not really "in" (inside, playing in) a Shape.
- Shapes is working with chord-level shapes, but key-level anchors. And bass notes, chord notes are tensions. 
- that's why shape and anchor needed to be separated. Tonal context and tonal center. Because if they weren't, we wouldn't be able to have this global idea, "Shape," that we can play with outside of these more local concerns.
- Also: the difference between a bass note (chord-level anchor) and a chord "root." That is, the difference between a chord as expression of a mode, versus voicing of a triadic chord structure.
- And the relationship of bass note patterns to establishing a key-level anchor





## 8 - What is a Tonescape?



do i care about the future stuff? this may be about the keyboard disappearing, and about bouncing yourself off something external and rational.



- Include future tonescapes sequence overview (where this goes from here)
  - or maybe it's not the future sequence that matters, but the notion of hearing an entire tonal space at once...

- things going on:

  - listening inside of a complex sound. like being able to hear individual pitches in a chord
  - focus, active listening
  - and pitch training. anchor and tensions, which will connect to analytical skills down the road
  - This is getting at an internal mechanism of being able to speak this language of pitches, that's controllable, it's part of a kind of fluency.
- also a relationship between "thinking v feeling" and how tonescapes enables (or highlights?) this, and the relationship of moods to chord-modes
- future talk
  - So you'll start to be able to hear a note in a song and know what it is, but you'll also be able to hear a note in your imagination and know what it is, and how to work with it, to sing it.
  - Once you've got anchor, 2 higher, and 2 lower, when you think about it, that's already 5 of 7 notes of the shape. So you're already well on your way to building your internal instrument. To translate that to a *real* instrument will be an intellectual step, but you're developing the perception that underlies that.
- "thinking or feeling": From a conversation with Josh after class 23.2.21
  - light/heavy as a framework, then mode names, then "dominant"
  - a superstructure of major/minor corresponding to light/heavy
  - if you reduce it to maj/min, you lose a whole level of nuanced hearing
  - *but then it's not necessarily about hearing everything modally: modes are a way in to hearing chromatic tensions to an anchor, that imply contexts. or even just to hearing nuanced tensions in context
  - the big thing to come out of today was that they wanted the logos, and then could believe they heard differences between the modes. but i set up shapes to try to work with just the feeling. that's a different skill, and it's valuable enough to foreground. it matters
  - josh asked why i don't just play the few notes we're working with in the tonescape. because we want every opportunity to parse the sound, to spend more time with it. And also, to hear the full context matters.





## 9 - Shape and Standard Notation



- start with the pitch relationships (remove key sig, accidentals, etc). but also talk about time:
  - in L9 the notes arrange pitch on the staff, but time is represented in the lines themselves, and pulse dots. 
  - then in L27, time transitions from the staff into the note symbols themselves. 
  - so in L9, a bass note that falls in between beats is notated between dots.
  - and this is still abstracted from clock time, or a piano roll, because the dots represent pulse, which can speed up and slow down, and these dots are regularly spaced. 
  - music notation is always, inherently a kind of relative time, not clock time. that may be its most important significant temporal difference from a piano roll. it's why scrolling notations have to speed up and slow down to match with clock time.

- There's no explicit sequence for the notation system--it's embedded across the other threads:
  - Staff is introduced in Lesson 9 - Notes In Time (Playing & Vocab)
  - used (and developed?) in Lesson 10 - Changes (Chord & Key)
  - Lesson 12+ (in SR Tactile Sequence)...
  - Lesson 16+ (SR Imagery)
- Think about this alongside FR_Music 3 Note Naming Systems
- Today I read the second Invention in the “5 Left” shape, where it’s neither Ab minor (7 flats) or G# minor (5 sharps), but just degrees in the shape, not nameable by letters. That’s a pretty fun way to think about what this notation is up to.
- (from making time relative) theoretical digression about beats as an abstraction (an idea that emerges from the music), even spacing as a further abstraction, and rhythmic note symbols as a way of adding more detail/possibility around the idea of the beat.
- something very different in reading the notation along with a song, starting at an indeterminate place.
  - closely related to structures (vocab) built around an anchor during playing
  - that could be part of the logic of developing a notation generator

i'm making an argument to privilege sound--not "warping" the waveform to the grid.

- does notation require a notion of time, and what different approaches to and representations of time are possible? think of a scrolling display versus symbolic rhythmic notation.
- after this notation, in theory, pulse dots would become regularly spaced (generalized away from the sound). Then rhythmic note symbols generalize even further to relationships.
- abstracted time, the idea of a regular pulse. think about how different this is from the actual events taking place in the music (shape and standard notation commentary?)
- The original wireframe for this lesson has a waveform underlying the notation. This is impossible if the dots are to be evenly spaced. It highlights that the concept of regular pulse, at least as a step en route to notation, is already an abstraction from the sounding events (in real time) that create pulse in the music. This is foreshadowed in Lesson 7 by the question of whether Bass Note events, as markers of change at the chord level, can (or should) be abstracted from the actual moment when they sound in the music, if that moment isn't exactly aligned with a beat.

separate key- and chord-level anchors are possible, but complicates the notation graphically. a good reason to move both into a mood name.





## 10 - Chord-Modes



- This is also a place to talk about the structure of the groups of shapes. Especially with the cosmology diagram. The second group sounds "floatier" because it stretches over more of the space.
- There was a thought to put this after 19 - Moods. But that lesson is more about begining to recognize specific moods, whereas chord-modes follow from the combination of Changes (Lesson 10) and Groups of Shapes (Lesson 11).
  - but still, 19 is supposedly the introduction to modes. 
  - also, how does this relate to the Standard Mode Names (commentary?) at Lesson 33?
  - so maybe a bigger question: what's the relationship/timing of thinking of combinations of shapes and anchors as chord-modes, and learning the sounds/feelings of each of those modes (moods) in the tonescapes sequence? isn't this sequence supposed to be linear?
- Merged Chord-Modes (after L11) with "Moods and Modes" here after L29.
- was a lesson, but this is really a commentary. It's probably written. What (if anything) makes it a lesson?
  - maybe call it "Moods and Modes"
  - also how does it relate to the chord-mode commentary after L11?
- from Spring 2023 wk6: the reason for neutral, light, heavy names is to give a kind of structure to the modes. to show their structure. but they have proper names, too.
- also when someone says "minor third" or "major third" they mean the light and heavy third.
  - there's also "perfect," a neutral concept
  - major and minor might be referring to proper names for particular modes
  - but more likely, they're referring to a general lightnes or heaviness of the modes
  - so you're getting "more major" / lighter as you go from dorian, Dominant, Major...
  - and people will say that dorian is a "minor" mode...
  - also a "dorian" third versus a "heavy" third. the first imbues the note with the whole mode. the second generalizes across several modes: dorian, minor, phrygian...
- and "major" and "minor" as ways of describing a general lightness or heavines of modes, versus the major and minor moods themselves.
- "light" and "heavy" vs raised & lowered allow the notes & modes to be their own thing, rather than alterations of some other mode

- The "Lowered 7th," etc. is in terms of whichever mode you're coming from. Dominant doesn't inherently have a "lowered 7th," unless it's in relation to another mode. It does have a "heavy 7th," though, that isn't lowered, per se, but describes a quality of the system of tensions overall.
- why is the dorian mode neutral? 
  - one, chosen because its not major, so bumps you out of those expectations that are hardwired from so much musical experience. if you can hear the different 3rd, it draws you into the sound more
  - but dorian is also actually neutral. three lighter and three heaver tensions in there.
  - part of an argument here that organizes the modes on a spectrum, that shows a kind of overall structure for the system of modes. that's pedagogical.

- 33 (tensions): [Theory: Standard Mode Names]
- Introduce standard(ish) mood names in place of light/heavy names.
- Also account for my funny capitalization practices: "Lydian, Major, Dominant, dorian, minor, phrygian, locrian," based on a supercategory of "Majorness"-as-general-lightness and "minorness"-as-general-heaviness.

- Also name 2nd, 3rd, 4th group moods and relate their light/heavy positions.
- *how does this relate to the chord-mode commentary following Lesson 11? and do i want to keep all standard terminology/concepts in the commentary, not the lessons?





## Glossary



#### Mode

The standard term that, among many other things it implies, can be interchangeable with *[mood](#mood)*.

#### Mood

The feeling, or mood, that results from all the relationships of notes within a shape, when they are organized into tensions around one particular note of the shape.

#### Scale

A way of "measuring" a mode or musical structure, by collecting all of its notes, beginning on the first note, and plaing the notes in order. Does this mean you can play the "scale" of a chord structure? Where is the line between a scalar structure (like, say, a Blues Scale) and a chordal structure (like a cluster)? Where's the line between a scale and an arpeggio? Does an arpeggio require a triadic structure?

#### Stroke

A line drawn on the keyboard, within the grouping of five or seven keys that surround two or three top keys, connecting notes that make up a shape. Each shape is the combination of two strokes.

#### Tension

a feeling of pull (position) from the anchor independent of octave (highness or lowness). So while a tonescape has, what, 17 notes in it, it has 7 tensions.

#### Position

positions from the anchor, like 2nd, 3rd, 4th... also letter positions, C, D, E, more generally than considering light/heavy versions of these positions. so all positions are tensions, but not all tensions are positions.

#### Note

doesn't consider tension. it's just the note. but you can perceive it in terms of tension.

distinction between "notes" and "tensions" here? Is the anchor a tension, or a note?

- --> they are notes. and the relationship of other notes to the anchor are tensions. so you can have the feeling of tensions, but you recognize notes, and draw notes out of the tonescape.
